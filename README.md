## Advanced Features

### Custom Configuration

Edit the constants at the top of the script to customize:
- Wait times
- Content selectors
- Minimum content length thresholds

### Browser Reuse

The script intelligently reuses the browser session between videos to:
- Reduce startup time
- Preserve extension state
- Minimize resource usage

### Error Handling

The script includes sophisticated error recovery for:
- YouTube player errors ("Something went wrong")
- Extension loading failures
- Network interruptions
- Stale elements and other Selenium issues

## Troubleshooting

### ChromeDriver Issues

If you encounter ChromeDriver compatibility problems:
- The script will attempt to download the correct version automatically
- If automatic download fails, it will provide instructions for manual installation

### YouTube Blocking

If YouTube detects automation and blocks access:
- The script includes automatic refresh and retry logic
- Adjust the wait times in the script constants for more reliable operation

### Missing Content

If some tabs aren't being extracted:
- Check if all tab types exist in the Eightify UI
- Increase the `WAIT_TIME_TAB_CONTENT` constant
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
