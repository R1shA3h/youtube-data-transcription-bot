    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 In the 1600s the Dutch East India Company employed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices, and silks around the globe. But running this massive operation wasn’t cheap. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens– individuals who could invest money to support the trip in exchange for a share of the ship’s profits. This practice allowed the company to afford even grander voyages, increasing profits for both themselves and their savvy investors. Selling these shares in coffee houses and shipping ports across the continent, the Dutch East India Company unknowingly invented the world’s first stock market. Since then, companies have been collecting funds from willing investors to support all kinds of businesses.\n00:56 And today, the stock market has schools, careers, and even whole television channels dedicated to understanding it. But the modern stock market is significantly more complicated than its original incarnation.\n01:09 So how do companies and investors use the market today? Let’s imagine a new coffee company that decides to launch on the market. First, the company will advertise itself to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the company’s initial public offering, or IPO. This launches the company onto the official public market, where any company or individual who believes the business could be profitable might buy a stock.\n01:39 Buying stocks makes those investors partial owners in the business. Their investment helps the company to grow, and as it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential and start buying stocks. As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing the cost for prospective buyers, and raising the value of the company's stocks people already own. For the company, this increased interest helps fund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value by showing how many people are willing to invest in their idea.\n02:13 However, if for some reason a company starts to seem less profitable. The reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock value is going to decline, they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes of making a profit before the company loses more value. As stocks are sold and demand for the stock goes down, the stock price falls, and with it, the company’s market value. This can leave investors with big losses– unless the company starts to look profitable again.\n02:40 This see-saw of supply and demand is influenced by many factors. Companies are under the unavoidable influence of market forces– such as the fluctuating price of materials, changes in production technology, and the shifting costs of labor. Investors may be worried about changes in leadership, bad publicity, or larger factors like new laws and trade policies. And of course, plenty of investors are simply ready to sell valuable stocks and pursue personal interests. All these variables cause day-to-day noise in the market, which can make companies appear more or less successful. And in the stock market, appearing to lose value often leads to losing investors, and in turn, losing actual value.\n03:23 Human confidence in the market has the power to trigger everything from economic booms to financial crises. And this difficult-to-track variable is why most professionals promote reliable long term investing over trying to make quick cash. However, experts are constantly building tools in efforts to increase their chances of success in this highly unpredictable system. But the stock market is not just for the rich and powerful. With the dawn of the Internet, everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways a large investor would. And as more people educate themselves about this complex system they too can trade stocks, support the businesses they believe in, and pursue their financial goals. The first step is getting invested."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 Vishal I read a stite that says that More Than 90 Par Of The Restaurants Go Out of business in the first three years it Self Biryani 300 400 500 years India In the World In Persia In the Arab World I am being eaten up I thought India why isn't there one from McDonald's sells nothing like biryani in India and Indians Favorite Gotu Dish Everything is in the Hadi for Biriyani. Bye kilo you are not a good cook but today You are doing a revenue of 300 crores. How did you first of all sell biryani Spot a gap, that biryani is in the cloud. It can become a kitchen brand in India today. This big batch of butter chicken or yellow dal or Is there a market for dal tadka or maki dal. But there is not a single brand that is completely. It is Universal in India, I have it in Mumbai. I have seen this restaurant in Mumbai too. It is a very glamorous business, one crore two crore. People invest money in such a way that they cannot get even one or two rupees. Even crores of rupees are invested in cloud Minimum to start the kitchen. How much investment will you need if you. You will see that many AT restaurants fail. It is done but only 18 and Shilpa Shetty's Bastian is only these two Restaurants That Are Wildly Successful. So what is so special about them that they became successful and other restaurants failed. Cloud kitchens have become a big deal in themselves. Restaurant business is a big category. Is cloud kitchen more profitable? It is profitable Friends. This channel is of Jaroda and Think School. There is a joint initiative through which we Providing world class business education to India.

Share the link Like and share for you. And subscription is free but our. This is very important for huge growth. Thank you so much for coming to the podcast this. This is the second episode of our Hindi podcast. And this is what I tell you about Claude.In the second episode Everything has to be learned in kitchen care because one. There is a huge debate in India about. Is cloud kitchen a viable business or not? If yes, then in which category and category. If you choose then what should be the location because earlier people used to think that You can build a cloud kitchen anywhere. People started making it from their homes. In 2015, people built cloud storage facilities in makeshift places. I started making kitchen and later understood them. I came to know that cloud kitchen is also a. It is a sophisticated business in which even your. The failure rate is 90% and very low. There is a possibility that you will be able to suck it and In between there is biryani by kilo Bharosa Biryani Faasos. All these brands came and He has written a playbook for cloud kitchens defined and you can use this playbook as a you are playing a very important part because you You have been doing cloud kitchens. Since people started Cloud kitchens were not hyped up that much and I just read in your revenue care. And I was very surprised to hear that That today you are doing a revenue of 300 crores which is biryani Fasticket and if you operate on this scale. If you are doing this then I feel one thing very much. I know very well that you have done a lot of things. I did your biryani right in Delhi. I have also eaten your biryani in Mumbai. I have eaten it too and it is just consistent and I know for a fact that Consistency is very difficult to achieve because I read it in mcdonald's and I know to what extent Ray Kroc. By doing R&D that standardization achieved so that even a 19 year old child I make equally good quality burgers as much as a chef can make so today. I am going to tell you. Everything you need to know about Cloud Kitchen in Kerala so that if anybody is watching this podcast he got a step by step guide. And avoid all those mistakes which make 90%. But people do this so that he gets three things. Let it be clear, the first thing is whether he Should cloud kitchens be opened or not? If you open it, then in which category and how? Choose the category and thirdly if that. If you can make cloud kitchen profitable then you can make it a If you want to make a business of 100 crores. Then it should start from 0 Which strategy to use for 200 to 100. I think you will have to use it a lot. I think this is a wide question about cloud kitchens.About but happy to respond to vast first tell me what are your. What is the story and cover it quickly because I want to tell this to the audience. I wonder how fantastic your journey has been. I know what your journey is. Because we talked a lot at the wedding crates on your thank you so much thank you so much. So I know your story but you Tell the audience. How you carry yourself. I will introduce you to them and what else can I say Would you like to know more about Biryani by Kilo? So I was born in Agra, after that I When I was very young my parents moved to Delhi. Then I did it from IIT BHU I did my engineering and then MBA from the US. Then I did IT business in India. Coming back in 96, I spent 10-12 years in IT. Business. Kara was quite successful. Then we sold it off. Then I moved to Singapore after 8 years. Singapore was 12 from 2004. So at that time I went into finance, so I I used to invest in a lot of businesses and My specialty at that time was consumer businesses. I was more then I came to India and We also opened a fund which we invest in consumer businesses. If I invested then I would be in food businesses. I have a separate position in Consumer Businesses. There was an attraction from the beginning, I felt that why isn't there a mcdonald from india or A Burger King or Dominos c McDonald's. Today there are around 40,000 outlets in the world and Their market is over $200 billion. The cap is like 17-18 lakh crore which will be available today. Our biggest company has a market cap of.While the burger is from India I think it's okay. It is a good product but from india Gujarati food, Maharashtrian food. Is it our Assamese food or do we belong anywhere else? Our Kashmiri food is very delicious if we have one. Then I thought why don't. We have one. Anybody can become a big company from India. In category I thought that in biryani can become a category because what is in it. See Biryani has been in India for 300, 400, 500 years in the Arab World in Persia. I am being eaten and everybody knows it and What is in. Biryani is that there is also rice which It is carbs but it is good carbs like English I talk about gluten or wheat based that brother who probably isn't feeling so good. Today I believe that the flour is in the pita or in the burger. If yes then the rice is better than that and there are spices too. Each has its own flavors and many more. In versatile English they say that brother you How to make Chicken Biryani Biryani can be made into Mathan Cutlet Biryani Paneer. Biryani chole biryani any kind of and finish in the same pot in miles such as If it is dosa. Then a lot more is needed with dosa and If you deliver, it will be a little saucy. Or will the roti also be a bit mushy. It goes well with sandwiches or even with biryani. No problem, you can deliver it today. You can eat the complete meal the next day as well. It happens that biryani is a category that if one does some good work in it like McDonald's did it, Domino's did it world wide which has been standardized. The product to I made it to the student board but the test was. And we kept the same flavors that we had at home me, our grandmother, aunt, or whoever our father Brother, whatever you make is the best. If you do it while keeping that then you can go to this category.We can save the fun in India only no outside. India. Also we have mcdonald and Can become a bigger chain than Burger King. Thinking about this in the world I said that I am sharing my entire US experience Singapore's experience of investing Experience scaling an IT business. If I put everyone's experience into this I was able to create a company from India which could do all these Can give tough competition to big companies hai to matlab de will make me really proud. And I can make India proud so can you. You are a typical Indian son who first. He did engineering, then MBA and then he I started a startup because my father told me to I told you to do engineering first. Then do an MBA, then open a startup something will be sorted out. But Vishal tell me did you already know how to make. Biryani I am not at home, I probably mean tea Omelet was a basic when I lived in the US for a year. So I used to do cooking, then came to India and got married. Then I became so busy with work that I I'm not a good cook, I just couldn't become one. I guess you're just not a good cook. But today you are running a brand worth Rs 300 crore. If you are here then how was this journey, I mean how did you do it. You first of all spot a gap ki biryani. Cloud kitchen brand can be created in India itself. Because you started in 2015 Right in 2015, cloud kitchen was an herd of concept in india. Yes to 2015 I am in the world of cloud kitchens in India. It wouldn't have been so much at that time if you. If you look at the world then it is matan which is. It is the largest food delivery chain in China. Like Zomato is Swiggy in India. At that time Grub Up was just starting in the US. Seamless was already there but do dus has just started Was Delivery Hero delivering in Europe. It was just starting out, so it was a cloud kitchen. The concept of was just starting but because I was an investor so I had this idea what is happening in the world and in India.Because real estate is so expensive. That it is very difficult for restaurants. I go to India and get the rent. Such percentage of if I say total sales. If the dining becomes too much The restaurant goes up to 15 p.m. That's pretty much it for 5 in cloud kitchens. It happens in restaurants and dining. It takes a lot of money to build a capital Cost, Look and Feel of Cloud Kitchen. What is the use of that you have said it anywhere? Built in the area, even on the first floor. You can build it either on the second floor or on one. Can someone build you an industrial building? To pick up at the mall in high slit. If I don't need it then I said it's good. There is business in india because here there is a So. The density of population is very high and Basically the traffic is increasing. And everybody is now earning double income. In big cities where I am in Singapore 8 year lived there so if we say that if you eat 100 meals a month Three meals a day, 90 or 100 in 30 days. People travel 100 out of 100 miles towards home eat out. Some 100 meals huge out how can I eat because in their house you have to Maybe I too would be surprised to see such Indians I was surprised, especially those who are Chinese. I went to his house in Singapore at 90. There is no cooking oil at home, why only Tea is made because look there is food there. They made it so hygienic and cheap. After home, I have given you a food stall at the street corner. The course is available anywhere you go - Sal Jo. The salary of a common man is very basic. There. Everyone has Rs. 3,4000 so that's even. He is a taxi driver and that too outside the house. I eat it because it is very hygienic and cheap. It is good, then that culture is also present in India. Currently the data of Zomato Swiggy in India that those 20-30 million are the top ones. Paying customers are most loyal, that too for a month. If I order from 4-5 meals only Our journey is still very long, but it will happen. It might be true, but today I will give you an example. So two million orders from Zomato means 20. Daily delivery of lakhs of orders is almost the same Swiggy is. On its way, this is what China is. I have 30 times their daily delivery which is 60. There are 6 million orders per day. But they also have 30 times more restaurants 2.5 lakh on Zomato Swiggy in India. Restaurants are listed but you think 88.8 million in China, around 90. There are lakhs of restaurants listed my God. Because as women in India Traffic will go into the workforce, it is increasing. Hey everybody, you know pollution is increasing. Then gradually the cost of food will come down and the food at home will become hygienic. Outside, it was like a Peepal tree, first we From Agricultural Economy to Manufacturing. I went to I then went to service, now I went to AI. If you are there then you should be in the same food as well. Food becomes cheaper and more hygienic and labor costs go up as that now today perhaps in India. We People meds are probably available for Rs. 00 to 25000. But after five years from today it may be Rs. 60,700. If you get it for a thousand then everybody should eat slowly and The cost of food will get cheaper, which is great. If this happens then people will either start eating outside food or If you want to dine in or order delivery then this. The sector will keep growing, so that's why you. It was decided that this is a growing sector. It is a growing sector and here you have a If you want to start a biryani brand. Then I am your I will come to the category a little later, so the summary If I tell you, you thought that Density of population is very high in India. It is very high and it is high in China also. But the ceiling of China is very. If it is too high then India's ceiling is less than. It can reach at least 50, see China's economy which has GDP is higher than India's five to six times bigger than four trillion. There is 20-22 trillion there, so four or five multiplication is understandable but you see 30. The price of Swiggy is basically two times that of Jamet. Like you I am 20 lakhs dars daily. Matton's 6 Crore hai got it so first was your population. Density metric second was real estate. Because for the restaurant you need to prime. Real estate is needed and cloud kitchens you can setup it anywhere and thirdly Eat out frequency in India. Currently it is four to five times per month also 2030 million which is the best customers. There are four or five of them but I am going to tell you this. We are not even talking about the remaining 1.4 billion Okay, that too will increase now and you feel is that your hypothesis is that the next. In two-three years, in fact in the next 10 years. As India becomes one trillion dollar. If you keep adding this brick to your GDP then The out frequency will increase due to which Both eat out and delivery. The frequency will keep increasing due to which this. The market of cloud kitchen is very. A big market will be created, a very big market. And if you establish yourself today. And if you have found yourself all over India. If you have established it then your brand. Then your brand will have some leverage. Because of which you will become a beneficiary Right and not just in India you should see that biryani is such a good product today or Kebab ours or many types of our food Be it Gujarati or Maharashtrian. As India's hard power is increasing Our GDP is increasing, so our soft. Our power will also increase like that of Bollywood. There is entertainment in our Diljit's eyes, faults are everywhere. We are going to eat our food like this. There are still many people who eat it outside India. But in as many standardized forms as If the brands are not big then they are from India. The huge size will grow outside as well, what can I tell you. Let me tell you, I went to Dubai and I had hope there. Yes, there is a restaurant of Asha Bhosle. Yes. I went there and I told them. I asked can I get a table for two. Then she said no there is a wait time said ok how much is the wait time and he said 50. I said ok no problem 15 minutes. Minutes are fine no sir not 15 50 Minutes 50 minutes waiting time and restaurant.\n14:37 It is so big and I looked outside and saw the whole empire were standing outside and inside too. There were emrass and address. No, people come from so many places to eat Indian food. Then I saw that this is so Amazing and I went there and ate chaat and That is one of their most popular dishes. Then I thought like wow this is true n Amazing moment because we are in India. We eat Chinese food in India. They eat and drink americano but these. It is a matter of such pride that India's. It is a chart and has become the best seller in Dubai today. It is done and Indians are not eating it. Every person in the world is able to eat that chart so tell me that and that's it by the way South Korea has also done it and we have worked on it. A case study has also been made that of South Korea. How to use pop to make your soft is increasing the power because of which South Korean Food South Korean Beauty Products Everything is becoming famous all over the world because of which the South Korean brands. They are also very easy in the whole world I am able to grow myself because The adoption rate is towards South Korean culture. It has grown too much, so this is your. The fourth parameter is India's rising Soft power which will be very important. In the next 1020 years. It will increase a lot. It will not increase 102 but five 10. In years, even in 510 years, a lot has happened. It will increase, it will increase a lot because as After in any country like US second world war in 1944 45 once heart. When the power increases then all these McDonald's and you look whoever starbucks is. These dominos were all from the US in the 1950s and 60s. Once the hard power increased, the soft power came out. When power also increases then people think that brother. If someone is doing very well then the rest of them Things will also get better and in India.Especially you see our food is very layered. The flavour is very even and it is very good. It is different, every region is very different. Variety of spices, variety of cooking styles like if I say it like British. If you go to Britain, you can get a simple one like Fish and chips is their main dish right. So there aren't that many wide ranges like. We have so much depth in our food. I have full confidence in the region that The world will explore our food. I'll tell you guys all about our flavors once. If you understand things then it is very big. There is a very interesting opportunity. Now. Tell me why did you choose. Biryani first can you please walk me through different categories of cloud kitchens and Tell me so I understand this now. It has come to light that cloud. Kitchen is a booming market. And if you do four or five things right I know your business will flourish.This is clear to me but now I need to know the category Sneak in and tell me. This is what Claude is up to Most Popular Categories in Kitchen in India. Which are they and what is the strength behind them? And I want to know about its weakness like in the South Indian world. If people. They say that I am for South Indian food. If I open a cloud kitchen then I will be the biggest one in it. The threat is that you can make Idlies very easily. You will take it but when it comes to dosa then. It has to be crispy and so on and so Fourth, where you can get into a lot of trouble so in the same way tell me what is cloud. Who is in the top five categories in India in the kitchen. Like you said food should be delivered friendly. Right like peas are very big. The category is Sabzi and Biryani the biggest. The category is Cloud Kitchen Pisa in India. That's why you know when Dominos is in India. When Jubal started it in 96, he was the one Food delivery is one of the most popular food delivery systems in India today. The delivery is so known as Give It First Zomato said later Dominos was known in India for the food delivery so he Food delivery made Pete Sa very popular. If you eat the paste after one hour So it becomes soggy or a little sticky. It happens that's why dominos said we I will give it in 30 minutes only, that is why it is popular. Paya is also a pita which is a celebratory meal. There's a party, I ordered food. It's easy, four or five people.Ate it together. 10 people ate the same thing and it became easy in biryani in biryani like you I Said that you can eat it the next day. Too Chicken Biryani is versatile, make cutlets paneer. Biryani is very easy. Food is one, carps are also found in it, rice. If I get protein in it then it becomes easier. The pita is very big, the biryani is of course very big. The kebab is big, very big, North Indian. It is very big of course. Yes. Basically everyone needs it. I want to eat makhani and roti and thali. Because it is our staple meal Everybody has a staple meal and like you said. Like it is a bit difficult among South Indians. Because people want crispy dosa. If you want things then you need the biggest. This is the category in India and then Ofcourse ice cream is a big delivery. Category Desert is a Big Delivery Category even like sushi which is sushi which is japanese food. Now a very big delivery category is emerging. So all kinds of food will be delivered. The Mexican will also go, he will also go, but look. It has to be looked at in such a way that which In which region do people like to eat? There is difference in this also if I look a little. If I take the example of FMCG then these are also different. You see, it is basically Horlicks. If you see, it is very popular in South and East. It is popular in South India and East Butter moves north and west because People drink Bonvita by adding it to milk but the glass glaxo smith line whose It is Horlicks and it is their boost. But Boost is very popular in Tamilnadu so my What I mean to say is that first look at the food. People's habits don't change so easily Hoti Pithas to be launched in India by Jubilant. Established from 96 to 2010 15. 15 it took 20 years so if there was any one in Tamil. If you eat biryani like food then you should eat the same.You will have to create more cloud kitchens. You can try any category, be it Mexican but it will take time for the taste to change. If it takes time to do it then the food which is there. In whichever region, state we eat, By giving the example of cloud kitchen to people. By incorporating in but doing it this way. You will have the same experience in delivery as well. If we get it which is made in their house or. If you go to a restaurant, you would enjoy that experience. You will have to repeat through the packaging how they are cooking how they are delivering the. So you said that the food is top in cloud kitchen. The fifth food category is Biryani Kababs Pizza North Indian and Ice Cream and Sushi. We are not Sushi so Sushi is developing Sushi. So It is developing, I was taking the example from the top. There is no pert developing, so if top. If you want to tell me five, what will you tell me? N order lets say yes so in order then you. If you see, biryani is number one or number two. It is Pisa and if you see number three then you are in North. You are Indian, North Indian and you are number four. If you look at it, it is Chinese because people. If you like Chinese a lot then look at number four. So Chinese and Asian food, we are number five. Five I would say ice creams and deserts because people have impulse. I want to eat food quickly but I have to choose a category. It is a lot yes but you are saying that top five. This is the category okay. Now let's come to that. How do you choose the category?He said that the first variable is. Is it delivery friendly i.e. if cloud kitchen. If your food is prepared and shipped from And in Mumbai city, one can go from here to there. It takes one hour so if your You have 30 minutes or an hour to deliver. For, in that time period your Food is in any way a matter of quality should not degrade into. Like if your dosa is crispy then. It should be crispy if your. If it is biryani then it should be hot should and so on and so forth like if If you have pizza then it should not become rubbery. Rabri yes if your a North Indian. Then it should not become steal and it should not become. Cold. Flavors should remain the same, hot should remain the same I want to have experience cooking at home. Or you can go to the restaurant and get delivery there. I got it so this is it. Delivery second done test huge if in to find out through experimentation that Which test is conducted in which state in India? It lasts the most so what should I do Should. I just go to the market? One should read the research report to see if it. Some exercises can be done for this. I don't have any market research reports.\n22:22 It seems that every reason has a meaning. If it is then it is very broad. I think. There is one Zomato Swiggy Teams and whatever this sub teams also if you know any First of all they have a lot of data. Can I call Zomato or Swiggy and get help from them? I can ask for this data, it is probably a little. It's difficult to ask for it, it's a little difficult but Now both of his companies are publicly listed. It is real, it was just publicly listed this week and Zomato has been there for quite some time. Public reports contain a lot of data which anyone can see.But I think this Market research is, in my opinion, a I think it must be first hand Go to restaurants and order food yourself. If you want delivery then you have to pay in Mumbai. If you want to find out this in Andheri West that what are people eating here then you how will you find out in andheri west Travel around for 10 days a week, eat and drink a lot Drink and increase your weight, spend little money. If you do it, I think you get a feeling that people. What type of food do you eat. Because whatever you eat we will eat at home only, it is not that at home. But we will eat something else which we cannot eat outside. It will remain the same if you look at Bombay. There are also many old restaurants in. If you grew up in Bombay, you were like Sardar ji. The pav bhaji seller is Tardev P His career has been in Bombay since 1960-70. It is being sold, it is being sold in a queue and It is a business worth crores if you look at it. I think samosa is there for more than 40-50 years. Most probably it is in Bombay, so anyone can see it. Product Samosa can also be sold. As Pav Bhaji can also be sold, your plate can also be sold. But see what it is that you should specialize in. You will have to do this and your product. It will be different and the customer will get one. People say in business that you need to get a grip. You will have to wonder why you should eat only your product. It needs so much flavour as well as delivery. Friendly is also required and along with that sanitization is also required. It is also necessary that it continues to be a company brand. It becomes we got it so you are saying that You have to do ground research for the test. If you have to do ground research then you will have to do this. To get the customer to understand that he is coming to this region. What to eat in this city and this area I like it. But this can also happen together that if you look Mexican if you Are you introducing it in India or someone. Suppose you are making a dish that If people don't eat it in India then. You have to go by your gut feed because people are not eating them right now. It will be very difficult for me tomorrow. In fact Rahul was talking to Sasi. Then Rahul Rahul Sasi said a very important thing I told you that only two options are left, one is this that people in cyber security. Educate yourself in which you will spend your whole life or you can go directly to the government Talk to them and tell them to look. At this. There is a problem it can be solved by that. By the way, I believe that infact I have done this study after doing market research. Through it has been found out that in the market Most money should be spent. On education. It goes like hail and u is they. So much money is spent on education that Right now they actually have their own business. Operating profitably is the right thing to do hey. Wich is really a difficult thing to do so hum. In my opinion if you have the top five. The category and market are so big, so it is.It is safe to get started with the f but If you are in Gujarat then try Gujarati food. If you can in Maharashtra then Maharashtrain You can eat a very big one too. There is a possibility, well this has happened regional so you know that regional. This is if it works. Then you can do it. Okay and You said that you can understand this from public reports. Can you find out which category is the best? It is selling a lot. So one delivery is done. Second. Test is done, third variable. I Should I consider whether I will be included in it. Will. I be able to standardize or not? Will I be able to standardize or not? Massive standardisation is something that It sounds very easy. But I know how much standardization costs is. There any difficulty and how much It's complicated, but I know it. No matter how much hard work you put in, it's not an easy task. So tell me where to stand exactly. See what happens in sanitization. I am from an engineering background. I have done engineering from IET BH. So what are those two things that you need to sanitize? A process requires one input material. If you have processed the input material. If given then the output will always be the same like. If I say it in simple language. What goes into making biryani? Rice Rice goes Meat or Paneer or Cutlet goes spices go, some curd goes. If the pot goes in which we then Like the pot in which you put your strength. That is, the same is delivered to the customer in the same. Then we should do all those things. First. Input has to be sanitized Input Surprise. Give all the inputs whatever your material is. It cannot be that there is someone in the company. You can also buy it, it should be a central purchase only and should be from the same source and Every time that material comes, a Quality check should be done to ensure the same specifications. But if it is there then we buy rice only. They buy only Daawat's premium Basmati Our Handi is naturally aged for two years which It happens due to the soil or thickness. Is it or is it mouth. Everything is standardized. Our chicken pieces or our cheese. This is our spice which is ground from each and every thing Standardize.So can you buy Zomato Hyper Pay. Would you recommend it. Here, yes it is very good. We are their products because long ago. If we do it with them then we will sell their products too. We buy it and also buy it from our vendor ok ok so you are saying that the first thing that You need to standardize. There are some parameters of sanitization in it. Inputs have to be done which material is taking. The process needs to be processed as well as inputs. The work is difficult, the process is even more difficult. If it is work then we have talked about input parameters that there should be central purchase. In the purchase we talked about if you have. There are many branches, so every branch has One should not procure his own goods. The central branch itself has all the Whatever ingredients you have, you should procure it and there you will find your. There should be a quality check that whatever you Ingredients Purchase and choose whatever KPR you want. Do you procure 2 kg feast, right? Two Years Old Is Naturally Aged Two Years. If you do naturally aged feast then you. How to do it naturally after two years. There is a feast, we have to gut it after that. We come to process standardization. So how can massive process standardization be achieved? It happens like this, I am an example. If I take it then our pot is in it when When the order comes, rice and meat are served either. It goes to cutlet or chicken. Whichever spices go like but what is it that if As I said, it is the input of the pot. It came in the material that how big is the bottom. How open is the mouth, rice and so on. Now it is said that if 40 grams of rice is added in it. It has to be put in a pot or 200 grams should be put. If it is there then it has to be that much, then it has to be late Sum Measurement. It is not that he has his I poured it as per my wish, I poured it in a ladle full. It can't be possible. It has to be wed that brother. Only 200 grams of rice will be used or else 190 grams will be used. No it will go to 210 grams if the spice is 12 grams. If it goes then only 12 grams will go if what is in it. The quantity required will be as much as it is.Then when it goes into the oven, the moisture I want temperature, it is not that any go to the gas stop and guess by yourself shook or made or by seeing that If you think that something has been done then it has been done because every. If there is a chef in the kitchen, then it is different. His thinking may be different. Then V Don't believe that there should be a chef in the kitchen. If you want to grow your business very big like mcdoyle is there or they don't have any. A chef doesn't have a system, he is a surprise that every person is doing his own work in the kitchen. If it is there then do that work just like it is in process. It requires absolutely exact measurements. Exact temperature is required, moisture is required and Then it happened that there was no follow up. There should be regular training. We have AI enabled cameras in our kitchens that People keep looking to see if any step is missed. So it didn't happen or something happened in between. If there are many mystery audits then. First, you have created the input sanitization and process as well. How do you measure whether he is following you or not? It is from an enabled camera or it is from an audio. Whether it is in the customer feedback. We have also it seems that our complaints point 5. But there is more than that in the kitchen. Then his All system processes are audited. Then that kitchen is checked by then one of its. There should also be a system of audit and follow up whether it is happening or not. It Vishal, you mentioned three things, one of them is this Check that people are following that thing are you following me or not for that. It has an AI enabled camera, I will try to find out a little about it. And the second part I'll talk to you about is your process is the process that All the matrices in it are very. It is specifically measured, how to measure it. If you do that then you will understand the process it will go as you make it and the third one which would have been that is audit. You check the audit now. Firstly I need to do Audit & Customer Feedback Audit customer feedback so you told me three things one.So this is that whoever is our employee, We have given the process, follow it. The second thing you need is that your process. It should be so well defined that anyone. The employee can follow him. The third is that you have a quality check. For this there should be two processes, one is this. The mystery check is done, second thing is that If your customer complaints are increasing. So you will go there and do the audit, first Let us come to the first step that is AI enabled Cameras that check whether the employee is following you or not. Are you following all the processes or not. How practical is this solution? Like this everything becomes known quite 80 90. But it gets known at 10, so those people who Continuously looking at the cameras. They also have to watch, but that camera it helps them that brother if they. It seems that you can program the camera. Brother, if you put 12 grams in it, you can so the camera is always watching that he I did not fill the scope. Completely, good for me tell me about it because I I can't imagine tell me Infact I will also take bill footage from you that. What does your cloud kitchen look like from inside? How does this AI camera work? Tell me how does this process exactly. Where is the AI enabled camera kept for work? So it is installed in the kitchen like the. It is installed in ceilings and in walls happens wherever a step is taking place. So that camera is installed behind that step. For example, suppose someone. Put 200 grams of rice in a pot in the kitchen is it ok if he wants to add 200 grams of rice. There is a camera behind him so someone. Seeing that in the central office, every kitchen. This man is putting only 100 grams, no I am putting 200 grams or not rice if they think it is 200 g adding 10 grams adding 190 grams because there is a weighing scale there. Measure out 200 grams in the kitchen and it has to be added further if it is of 200 grams instead if the camera sees that this. When he put 202 grams, he got alert whoever is looking at the camera from behind will do that. This one put 202 grams oh we oh wow okay so You have defined. This for everything has been done and with. Then on top of that there are audits every month. Every outlet is mystery audited twice that the audit team arrives any time I go through all the processes twice that he is not following or not. If something is expired then it should not be used. Anything that means process or input there is some defect in the material or the systems. It is not something above or below that. It's happening and then like I said, customer Feedback. If Customer Complaint % Our Thrush Hold is % of all the orders All the orders. If that kitchen gets 200 orders a day. If there are 6000 orders per month then 1 But. 60 orders were placed 60 Orders Right 6000 for 660 605 for 30. If instead of 30 orders if we have 31 orders People say 20-25 orders many times. It is subjective, someone may find that customer I didn't feel like a good. Day, but 5 out of 5 was. But even if it happens then a lot of that kitchen Rigas audit ensures that nothing is up or down. So if it is not going then that follow up process also it is very important and in our case I I would say Ganesha and it is very important. Because when biryani is made in our pot and it is sealed so we can also open it. Can't see if rice is cooked in it or not cooked or chicken or cutlet cooked or not cooked customer. He opens that seal for the first time. Aroma flavors are what make up the fragrance. If flavors come then they are not sanitized so we don't even know if it was made right. If it is not made then it is very important for us.\n34:27 We got it huge you have two more things here. Mention things that the AI camera might not detect. All you can do is replace expired products. Usage and other hygiene then what do you do with it. If you check it in this way. Then first of all we are one. The culture in the company has been created such that this. Much like we say that our guest is a kind of guest in hindi. It is said in Sanskrit that guest is very important to us. A culture has been created in such a way that everything We should be very hygienic. We give him employment in our company that Every person is doing whatever work and then there are cameras. Hygiene is always visible in. There are many systems for expired also. There are processes, there are barcodes, you know QR. There are scanners that continuously check it. It keeps happening that if anything expired or going towards expiry if it is there then remove it from the kitchen first. So it also has systems and processes quite huge so tell me suppose one. It is a packet of masala which has expired. It has been 6 months now and now he is addicted to this spice. I am using the packet so how do you use it. You will find out that I am sending this expired packet. I am using this only, look first. We have so there are some sophisticated ways because We have grown a bit in scale etc. But I think first of all you have to understand a culture have to make it so that people are starting that sensitizing your employees so much. You will have to do this in a way to make your home are you cooking for me something that You can use it if it is expired or not hygienic. I think that culture is yours the best. It is a big safeguard in my opinion because When we started doing it, we had so many systems. The process was not there initially in the first kitchen so that's a culture should safeguard. I think that which training culture should safeguard but As it grows, our More than 100 outlets became more than 40. There is so much culture in cities, but it processes also because now on every packet. Technology is so capable of QR codes or do you have enabled cameras in any way Systems that can create QR codes.There is all the intelligence in it that if one. If there is an expiry date then every morning you can. That's how many items we have per employee will go and scan everybody, if anyone's. If the expiry date is more than that day then You will get an alert for that item that brother this is. It is expired and cannot be used today. If that is not possible then that systems process finally takes over once you become that big You become one, but I think first of all. That culture in a company that only the employees. It is important to be able to safeguard in the beginning. Because initially if a cloud kitchen Starting from one, maybe so many systems. If you could not complete the process then this happened process so if I explain it step by step. Let me define what is the process of the process. So the first thing is to find out whether Ingredients what is that so that a to z you know this second step is for second. Step is to make sure that this entity is Standardised by having quality checks. And this can be done in two ways one is culture. Where you educate your employees about the Importance of quality and the second thing do you have systems and processes which will check for some disease and here you. Used AI enabled. Camera and QR Codes are enough. Yes QR codes are auditable. The systems are very robust so like there are. We have online audit sheets online so when Like the mystery audit team which goes for audit. If yes then it can happen many times that brother. Some people change the audit report later. If they do it, all that gets audited online, when they. If you keep doing it then a video sheet is made goes and so do the people who go to audit. They are going, they can't change it either that someone because they upload it to the cloud. At the same time. Audit may continue, we are okay with it.Too. You have kept a check yes and if this all the systems and processes if your. It is completely set, then you can say that Your cloud kitchen is ready for operation. It is ready and besides this we have two more. Parameters include hygiene and expiry. You have QR codes for expiry and again for hygiene. You have to have a culture and the second is that you have A.I. There is an enabled camera through which you can see yes and that is why I am asking you this Vishal because I talked to a couple of people and he said that you have ever seen a cloud have seen the kitchen. So I said I haven't seen it. He said come let me show you. So in Pune he gave me a couple of slaps. Showed me the cloud kitchen and I was very surprised se dekha and it was disgusting from a very far distanced itself and I thought that friend I am ordering soup from here and After that my perception completely changed changed but after that I had a Saw a cloud kitchen from a sophisticated brand and I realized wow. This is Absolutely brilliant. So I understood that Cloud kitchen is a very big thing in itself.There is a category in which unofficially I understand that The perception that people have in their minds I want to start cloud kitchen business. So they think that cloud is available for one or two lakh rupees. Kijan business will start which is not like this and this is what you have called Systems and Processes Tell me these systems for any small business. This is not the end process of a big business. There are systems and processes which can be followed. You have become a big brand right so your 300 crore company is sitting on the foundation of Systems and Processes is why I It looks quite interesting. But I am Ganesh I would also like to say that probably the first Cloud kitchen is doing so much for it. Systems process maybe possible initially. No, because first they should see that the I am making stuff that can be sold. It cannot be sold unless the customer appreciates it. I am doing it or I am not doing it because in the beginning Any Entrepreneur starts cloud kitchen for Rs. 2 lakh. It may not be possible that it will open, but maybe. It can be opened in 8-10 lakhs or even in 10-12 lakhs. So first of all, I think that I still think he is an entrepreneur. The product market should come later. One should fit in and develop a culture. The company's gut it because the product market. If there is no fit and culture then systems I can't do anything about the process, gut it, it's okay Vishal, the delivery has been done, the test has been done standardization has happened do. We have any other Parrot butter through which we can gauge this Why This Cloud Kitchen Category Is Worth It Is it investing or not like I said said that if people eat that food like I said A1. Samosa is also fine then. Samosa You can also have a cloud kitchen if you if he knows how to standardize then. And if the product is market fit then you can start.I can do it, but I also don't know this. Also I want to say that people like maybe Sardar ji is the pav bhaji vendor or is there anyone else who. He runs only two outlets but if he. Their culture is so strong and they are a If you can earn this much money from the outlet. Also then Maybe they have 100 outlets or 400 outlets. If you want to invest then that would also be a good business. It could be huge or it could be very big. You said something interesting and not here. I want to ask you, the restaurant Business is more profitable that cloud Kitchen is more profitable, isn't it? See it could be. Both. It could be both. It depends on the driver but that's the cloud. Your capital cost in the kitchen would be slightly less. If there is a restaurant then see you get a rent. You will have to pay more, maybe you can buy it at the mall. Or take a place that is visible so that people can come. So the rent is also higher, you will have to pay capital for it. You will get a good table and chair and an environment. I will also have to pay so that people can eat further. Capital cost will also be higher in cloud. It will seem less but you will get food in the cloud. Delivery charges to be paid to aggregators. You will have to do marketing there too so the cost is there as well. So the cost is both. It's up to the way the place is run. I have also found restaurants very profitable. See also Cloud Kitchen and Both Non. See also Profitable. We tell me that Minimum amount required to start a cloud kitchen. What is the minimum investment required. I think I still need 8-10 lakhs. It will happen because and nowadays because now this.The industry has developed a lot, so on its own To Differentiable whether it is sashi or any category you are Well, there are many brands in each zone. There are 2 thousands restaurants on Zomato Swiggy. Firstly the product Differentiable I said it could be sushi, it is Anything can happen, so it becomes a fixed cost. What should be the working capital now? Minimum Working Capital for Cloud Kitchen. So look, this business doesn't require much.\n42:34 Because this is a cash business, whatever you sell. Whether you make your own delivery or Make that payment on Zomato or Swiggy. It comes in four or five days, it comes on the same day. It goes from behind also if you are not new so maybe. You also need stuff like flour dal rice chicken. You can get generous too, but if you want, maybe give it to me. Working capital should be between Rs. Lakh and Rs. 5 lakh. If it can then it's not a very capital. It is not an intensive business in the beginning but It may not be so easy to make it successful because now there is a lot of competition and There are many brands on Jat Saagi. Many restaurants have come so there is a lot of growth but a but differentiable okay so huge Restaurant vs Cloud Kitchen Units. Let me break down the economics. Tell me the most in the restaurant. What are the important cost variables and how much money do they cost so If I am fat in the restaurant business. Let me talk about the traditional restaurant business if you talk to older people. There are three main things. In a restaurant, one is rent where you have taken the place if you. If you have bought it in the mall, you have bought it on the high street. Where is it for Linking Road. Then it will cost 10 to 15. But mostly it is the cost of rent which It can go up to 20. In high, second is food. Food packing cost which is Rs. 28 to 35. In most cases it happens at 28 to 35 and The third cost is the labor of those who cook the food. If we are cleaning then generally 9 10. From 15 to 17 18 Between 9 to 18 happens if the restaurant is very big. There is a lot of service component in it. If there is sitting then service managers and servers. If there are many then it will be 9 to 18 or 10 to 18. Suppose there are three major costs if If we go into food delivery, the rent Which is around 10 to 15 food delivery. If it reaches 45 then it decreases and if I can do some labor. The cost is reduced because you. Your service person is not providing service. There is no staff and there are very few managers. Because you are creating an empty space, not a service. If you are doing it then the cost would have been Rs.16, 17, 18. If it comes to 89 then it will be 89 for you.There were 10 saved in labor and 10 saved in food. But yours is on 25 30 which you deposit in Zomato. You are doing real marketing and the commission. We are giving delivery that increases then z s How much will I give him for the commission he gets. Should I hold it in percentage? You should hold it roughly at 25. Let's catch curry at 25 for a new business. So the food remains almost the same 28. But it remains close but there is a little. If the packaging cost increases then it is because We will sell it to you by packing it well. If it is then close to 27-28 or 25-28 Food cost goes up and packaging at 45. If the cost increases then I am holding it at 30 hmm. Yes you should catch it at 30 to 35 Yes at 30 to 35 and average order value. How much in restaurant vs cloud kitchen. There is a huge difference, so it is like a cloud Zomato Swiggy's average order across India. If you look, there are 400-450 in the whole of India. If you see, one order is of 400 4. Mostly if you look at the restaurants then you can see all. There are types of you get food for 00 as well. And if you go for a little casual dine. So even a cheque for 800 Haj is of 2000 also happens then generally. If restaurants I would say that we are families in this should we go together or at least to Bombay or Delhi in Bangalore or Kolkata. So if the husband. If wife and two kids go then the bill for Hajj will be borne. I think it's a minor thing today. The average check size in the delivery business is 400. The average order is of Rs. 450. The value is less in the delivery business. It happens a little less and whatever you. There are margins that are significantly high but the major chunk out of that is Swiggy goes to Zomato. In commission. It goes okay so if I surprise this So in the restaurant you have 68. But all these three major costs are food and labor. After that there is some electricity also. There is fuel as well, so is some marketing Profit on Restaurant Businesses in General 15. If you are Devyani then you can do business from 15 that you run KFC in India. See or you can buy Sapphire Food which is KFC Pets. Hud or you are any person who is listed in Company Look if Restaurant Brands which Burger King runs so most of the people which is the profit margin EBTA margin which It is said that it is between 15 to 20. Even on that scale you can earn a margin of just 15% Getting 15 but the scale is too big. Naa you see today. Jubilant dominos is 5500. If he does business worth crores then he earns Rs. 15-20 per cent. I am thinking that it has not even reached thousand crores. I wonder if dominoes with that scale. Operating on margins of 15 not 15. It's around 18 20 21.So if I I should go and start a cloud kitchen today and I will have. If I don't have that much scale then my margins would be. So it will be quite less, yes I think 8 out of 10. It's probably hard to expect much if You start at 10, 12 or a little more. It is difficult. According to me, it should be at 8-10 gone okay and and okay so your fat. The thick net margin that results is cloud. How much is the delivery business in the kitchen. I see many businesses are as if we know if they get closed in food then maybe. It is always negative but those who do good. Theirs is at 1015 only so at both the places. It is around 101, yes it is at 101. But there are QSR businesses like KFC etc. Which have become old dominos. There. It happens at 15 20 gut. It ok. Vishal I read a stad that says peacock then 90 per cent of the restaurants. We go out of Doing It Yourself in the First Three Years of Business. So how did restaurants go bankrupt so quickly? It happens in restaurants. I say It's a bit like the movie business. It is a glamorous business, everybody thinks that one. If cooking is easy then open a restaurant. Let's take a chair and a table and some more. How to make good coffee, tea and burger sandwich. So open it so that I can see people. If it seems easy then competition always comes it remains because people keep opening it. It is. Like a glamour business like a sad movie. Competition is always there in business. Restaurant business has low entry barriers. Entry barriers are low in Yes because See, as we said, there is a cloud kitchen. If anybody has 5, 10, 15 lakh then he Start FSI by taking license at your place. So you can do it or in a restaurant if I also want to tell you about the restaurants which serve samosa sandwiches. He is also selling tea, that is also a restaurant right? So anyone can launch such a rocket. There is no science if suppose today. Mike not everyone can make this mic. Or the cameras and lights that are installed mean. It will require a technology, it will require things. Then to sell it and then it's so glamorous. Not every man has to make a little. Mike wants to feel good in speaking. A little is that my restaurant or I did this so take a little and people feel it. When they get home I watch the food being prepared or not. It is not difficult. We probably will and at least 20-30 lakhs in cloud kitchens and restaurants. Delivery business can also be started from cloud. If the kitchen is between Rs. 5-10 lakh then the entry barrier is less. There is always some competition which perhaps even if it cannot provide good food. So they keep ruining people's business for and this is one region, another region. What is that sanitization that I am talking about? That product market fit firstly because So many restaurants are always cloudy. The kitchen products that are market fit. They say that what we are making is the price at which they are making it and The taste in which the customer wants to eat the food. Always create, first create and then maintain. Sometimes it is more difficult to stay put. It is said that earning money is difficult. But it is more difficult to earn and keep. It is often said that to keep Lakshmi Saraswati is also needed for this correct. So in this also as you can see that quality Keep maintaining that restaurant Keep doing that, that is also a very big thing Brother that those systems should remain processes.Because a generation never produced a good cook. When he went, the food became good but if that cook When he left, the food got spoiled again because If you never create a systems process then it's like. Firstly, there is a lot of competition and entry barriers are low and then keep sanitizing it and then test it to maintain but in these businesses this is also Look at McDowell's, he's been around since the 1950s and 60s. Or is Domino's a Starbucks from the 1960's or 70's if it. If the business scales up and becomes good. Then this 50 50 100 100 years keep going on as if technology business. In 10, 20, 25 years Disers get fixed but they are in businesses. If Test Supply Chain Consistency Once If everything is ready then even these 5050 100 100 years. Both can work, very interesting. Both things are there so if The restaurant goes to the banquet because number. One baritone entry is very low so. A lot of competition keeps coming and going, number two. People cannot do product market fit. The third thing is that we cannot standardize because of which if you have done a I hired a chef and he left yesterday. If this happens, the quality of your restaurant will fall. Consistency goes away and you are unable to achieve it. Because of which your business runs into loss goes and the other thing is that the giant I have seen in Mumbai that even in Mumbai This restaurant is a very glamorous business. And people spent one crore and two crore rupees like this and I am quite surprised to see I go and tell people Rs. 1 crore or 2 crore. Just put one or two in the interior. If I don't get crores, I would have invested even crores I am talking about a small restaurant. I went to the restaurant and saw that it was one or two crore rupees. What kind of interior did you create then. I will understand I came and said that this is such a big place, there is so much space. And for this little space people built a house. Crores of rupees were spent on top of their rent. What can I say about the rent in Mumbai? I pay the rent myself. So I know what the rent is. How much is it. And when I look at the cost hmm.So I understand that prime. Setting up the restaurant at the location and later cancel it and make it profitable. It becomes so difficult to do that. Three types of people are required to recover their cost. Four or five years go by, then I I am telling you even less, if you successfully. If you run a restaurant for three to four years I will recover the money, otherwise people will charge you 10-10. Cannot recover money for years so what does it mean if there is so much glamour. It is so important that people 10 tips to open a restaurant yourself. Both things are one for a year's commitment. So glamour like you see in the movie business I I am comparing again and again because in the movie You can also see that if 100 movies are made then maybe. Only 10 are successful, maybe they flop goes on to give people. A glamour associated is with such restaurants that friends me friends me ri yes and friends. To tell my relatives that this is mine. It is a restaurant but I like the restaurant. This is a very good business but it has to be done for the right reasons that you. It is a very Operationally heavy business that brother everyday good. The food has to be good, the vegetables have to be good. Chicken has to be made through the same system process. Our service staff is always up to date. The culture should be in service mode. There should be a need for the customer to always be there. If it comes then there should be a good feeling, a good together. Then it is to do it for a very long time. Time Consistently It's Not Easy It's Not Easy means I would say that for glamour. And you shouldn't do it just for the shock. Think a little bit that this is your passion and Do it only if you genuinely want to do it. I want it and it's a full time job.It's a full Time Job Vishal tell me one thing this Celebrity restaurants like Virat Kohli has 18 and Virat Kohli's jo Kohli has Bastion Bastion. And I see that every time I I read about Beston or Vat I get so fascinated when I read about it. It is said that a celebrity whose eating habits are. He has nothing to do with that much I built a successful brand and when I After studying, I realized that Both of these celebrity restaurants are also good. There is no combination and if you see that A lot of celebrity restaurants fail but only 18 and Shilpa Shetty which Bastian is, these are the only two such. There are restaurants that serve wildly. If they are successful then what is so special about them? That these became successful and the rest Restaurants have failed, look at the celebrities if you look anywhere world wide. There is no beauty in empty restaurants. I think Deepika in products Padukone launched her own beauty. Brand Alia Bhatt also did some fashion of her own. The brand is being launched worldwide as well. If you look at it in many ways George Clooney launched his own liquor brand. Many people do this, see one benefit from it. So it happens that because people look up to celebrities Do you know Deepika Padukone or Shilpa? Shetty would have become a natural curiosity brother. Let's try it once. If there is a market to acquire customers. Then I am a normal brand which takes a lot of time. Being associated with these celebrities will seem. If curiosity increases then that first Time acquisition probably gets easier. The customer gives a chance once but It does not mean that the customer will return again. That is if the product has market fit. The customer will like the product Consistency in quality will be right. It will come only if there is a price, so if you say I am 18 and everything is going well. Because I don't live in Bombay, I don't know much Little do you know about the difference between these two brands. I ate it and it felt good. This means that they have created an operating partner Brother, if Virat Kohli's name is taken then it would be good. Or is it not the case with Shilpa Shetty? They know how to cook very well or they know system processes. He has no operating system behind it. A partner who understands this business very well I am coming, he must have taken it correct. Look, we have just elected Trump, we all have Kamala Harris. Ji saw this, who herself is quite is also good but he has many celebrities. From Upra Winfrey to Taylor Swift is endorsed by many people but This does not mean that Kamala Harris will win. When they went there they would see Kamala Harris. They will do it if their politics suits them. Their policy looks good, same. If you are eating something then you can use beauty products.\n55:55 You are saying that the customer action is from the tea. Because of this it becomes very easy but When the customer comes to you after acquiring. It comes for the first time, if you have done it well. If you do not feed then there is no chance of retention. No scope but if for customer acquisition. Afterwards if you gave them very good food. I like to feed you like Vat food very much then why won't. It work then it will. When it starts running then this is the initial push. The value of a celebrity is. It's the initial push. It's the initial push Now Kylie. Who is a huge influencer of the genre. She has many beauty products in the world. There are many fashion products that are in demand. If you are able to back it up. The product is your first chance to become a celebrity probably easy to get because of being go. It is very good amazing huge if I would love to order a biryani today from Cloud Kitchen. If I want to start then I need a unit of this. If you want a breakdown of the economics, then first Let's start with how much investment I need will be taken with all the systems and processes. In place. I don't want anyone to START. A FRUGAL ENTERPRISE I WANT TO am that such a Entrepreneur me, I want to give him 100 crores. If I want to build a brand then I have to start A Cloud Kitchen for Biryani Initial. How much investment will it cost if you. We do it through system process, you will do it through that. So it will cost around 50 to 70 lakhs 50 to 70 lakhs. But if a cloud kitchen is set up on a cloud kitchen you will do it through that system process because Everything of yours will come in it. Yes because we People use that equipment all over the world. We conduct classes which are all about hygiene and Those who do it for safety are very world famous. If you take classes then 60-70 lux should be applied here hey vishal. I have a question for you. All this has been done through standardization Input. Standardization Process Standardization but is there any such thing today? Company or any such category of companies. This will help me in standardization. So that I know that it's ok. I have a product like I have biryani I need to check expiry date for spices for this machine. This process is here. You will have to apply it so that the biryani gets cooked properly. Are such categories unfortunately still there? The ecosystem is not developed enough to to dye like if you were a steel.If you are setting up a factory then I thought because It would cost millions of dollars in capex. There are many companies worth 100 million dollars each. There is something I can get you to do but unfortunately this. The ecosystem is not yet developed enough to. There are so many big consultants or companies but There are definitely consultants who will guide you. But you still need to do a lot of decision research. You will have to do it yourself because there are many dyes no okay that means there is a huge gap. So, it is there in the market where you can buy brands. You can consult in standardization. Can do Consultant is also enough but you also need that much You will have to use it multiple times to get the right reach. A decision got it okay and How much working capital will I need? Look at the working capital, there is more I don't think so if it depends on your sales. It works if your monthly sale is 10 lakhs. If the sale is of Rs. 10 lakh then yours will be Rs. 3 lakh. How much will it cost if your sale is of Rs. 30 lakhs. Be it 6 or 8 lakhs because I said that Your cycle completes its rotation in four to five days. The goods that I bought and the money that I got, I used four or five Working capital for more than a week. It doesn't matter what your weekly sale is. Understand that you need that much working capital, got. It got it so if yours is worth 10 lakhs. If there is revenue then as per your unit Let's talk about economics, you will get involved in it Inshallah whatever your sale is for the week. You need enough working capital to generate cash till then. One week's sale amount gets collected. Working capital is required Working capital and a little more because you have to pay the labor. If you have to pay salary etc. Then one month of that of salary and keep lease you got it separately and As you mentioned in unit economics. That if your revenue is 10 lakhs then 10 Out of one lakh revenue, you will spend 80 to ₹ on Haj. Your month will be spent in labour at 30 to 35 i.e. 35 lakhs from that will go into food and rent Food and Packing Food and Packing Yes.The rent for a restaurant is Rs. 25 to 30. For cloud kitchen as you said 5. But % yes means 40 to 0000. Your rent I will go okay and by the way how much is this. If it is for square feet then generally this Cloud Kitchens 500 600 Sq Ft. In One. If you want to do it for the brand. Then it becomes 500 600 sq. Ft. Okay, this is what we are. Gaya Birni Ka. Log. 200 300 Square Feet I also do it, which is quite common these days. There are cloud kitchen companies which are offering 200. She gives 200 square feet to people. Even if there is an empty burger shop in square foot. There are empty sandwiches so there are 200. It is also possible in square foot, okay and Tell me how much labour it takes for you. To operate a cloud kitchen. Because our sales are high. It seems like a lot but a normal cloud kitchen. It can be operated by four or five people. Is it good and how many in your cloud kitchen. We have about 152 people are the sales also good and our. The delivery riders are also quite often our own. If there are, it takes 15-20 people of ours. Cloud kitchen maintenance also costs 25 rupees which It is big but tell me one thing if you. If we sell biryani by the kilo. So you don't have to pay commission on 25 or 30. Then would you give a discount on it. Yes I will give you your biryani. And we also give loyalty points Anchorage Customers' Biryani by the Kilo Download it from the app and do it from the website. We have an all India call center, contact us through them. Ok got it interesting our dining. There are outlets all over India, it is good. So you have started dining out now, yes? No, we have been doing this for many years, so in every city. There is also a dining outlet for. If you want an experience then you should go to Delhi. In every city except Bombay, in 40 cities. There is also one dining outlet in each of the 40 cities. You have outlets, yes wow that's a lot. It's good ah Vishal tell me this which is above 50. Your investment in this is Rs. 70 lakh. How much do you sell per month. Then we People earn around 23 lakh rupees per month from one outlet. Let's take Rs 253 lakh per month got it. That is You can earn up to 35 crores in a year. Let's do it and you told that its net Your margin is 10 to 15 on 10 to 15. Ho ok got it ok vishal. After this I would like to talk about your acquisitions. I am guessing this and you can correct it. Me if I'm the one that cracks your systems. You did it, you cracked the process. How many outlets are there in total in whole India Right now there are 110, 110 outlets, so you have. There is a lot of data, so you know that Which outlets are around Hire Per Capita. There are income earning people who sell your products.I am wondering if people buy this that all the brands you have. Have you acquired Goella Butter Chicken? Which other brands did you acquire? Awai that acquire kara get away get away to. Get. Away is a healthy dessert if you Sugar free or low calorie or you know healthier. If you want desserts then add get away ice to it. There are creams and cheese cakes are enough if there are products. Then I am guessing that Acquire your butter chicken and get away with it did because in your top five category. One is ice cream and one is North Indian. Yes Burgers are also in the top five but we don't order burgers because we feel Maybe our right to win in burger pizza. It's not that much why it's like that because look. In Burger Pie I think Pie Domino's. And today we have been doing Pi Heart World. Wide Domino's India has a net worth of around 5500 crores. Jubilant's revenue is equal to that of Domino's master Maybe 1000 of the franchising player crores and the Indian brands which They are big, we are worth 200-250 crores. I think the big players are very. There are significant differences in this. You have huge burgers. Here. Blue Ocean is Biryani, a very big Blue Ocean. Not that you like when mcdonald's so Burger King is so big it's 5050 100 50 such good burgers. Their supply. Chain brands are so big so maybe a little. If there is an ambition to become as big as C then It might be hard to compete with them. I'm not saying I can't have more biryani or in kebabs or in Indian food. Like Goyla Butter Chicken is the name Butter Chicken but Daal. It is very good and the kebabs are also very good and other curries are also North Indian. Food is I think one of our favorites. If such an Indian company has the right to win then I Tell me one thing now that you have made Goela Butter Chicken. If you have acquired it then now you can buy these products. What can you do so that it grows I am guessing that it will be done. Because you have systems and processes. If you have distribution then you can. This will take the brands pan India this correct and is there mole to it's to us. We have already taken Goyala Butter Chicken and We can do two things to get away, such as Goyla Butter Chicken.When We Had Majority Stake Lia Saransh Goyala is a master chef who is still Join us and work with us. We are doing this and we are very proud to be associated with them so when they we Kara majority. Then there were five outlets and six outlets. There were 90-100 outlets. Today, now 900 outlets are late. If it happens then we will grow it India wide and then we were able to do the road in which Our specialty is audits. Systems are able to complete the process because Today in India such a big butter chicken Yellow dal or dal tadka or maki dal. There is a market and North Indian food is available on. There is not a single brand which is not available in the whole. India is as universal as fried chicken is there KFC or Dominos in Pisa or or There is pain but not even one among North Indians. If not, then we need to create Indian brands. I have to take you to Pan India and the world I got it very interesting huge. I got a This is a very weird question and you are the one who asked this can you answer me one thing. Tell me if I have a restaurant near me that is running and I can also make deliveries from it. I am in that the best of both Worlds that I can even run a restaurant and I am also doing delivery. So I Tell me one thing if there is a restaurant and this I know retail, I know fashion. If you have a store which is your brand. The value is increasing a lot. Because people can come and feel your clothes Can experience your brand. If you can do it then what happens to it. Perception is developed very well. And in a way, a trust is also formed. Because they will never visit your store You can tell them that look this cloth is nice. If not, then I know that it is in fashion. If you have a physical store, your The brand value is high due to which There is a lot of profit on your online sale too. Has a greater effect in the same way if You have a restaurant like you would a restaurant on your. Physical outlets have you noticed that a Restaurant which is very well known. Its online presence in the market yes it is very effective edge.Compared to a cloud kitchen company which is Selling the Exact Same Product Weather That Could Be Biriyanis and Kebabs. Yes no both things are correct and ours too. Like. We are more than 40 in 40 cities. So we would have a dining outlet in every city. Whether it is Delhi or Gurgaon Be it Bangalore or Guwahati or Kolkata. There is a dining outlet and right now we. Airports and highways are also getting Customers experience with our product. So he can also do it in dine in and out setting. So there are so many online companies in India whether it is in fashion or beauty. Everybody has Rs. 3,400 crore and 500 somewhere. Many people have gone offline above the crore mark. And they have got the advantage and so have we. Our dining outlets are closed from today. Its been there since last year but because of biryani. And this category of ours has many people. If you consume more in your home then We focus more on delivery. There is dining as well but like you said but There are many different types of dining options available for those who want to dine. I would say it is a business that is in the dining industry. Sensibilities are required and those of the business owners DNA is required and whatever is required in delivery. It is not necessary that they be the same as if Ajan. Its books became such a big company. In delivery music in delivery you are everything. If you do something then it is important that it is appropriate at that time. Joe Detail Outlet in Music in Books. Those who used to drive, could not do it or blinked today. It is not necessary that I could do it. But what can you do with. The food you serve to him? You can eat a little if you. There is some ups and downs in the dining so. The server can change the customer. That chance in delivery can satisfy you. You will not get it because you have done the packaging. Its tax systems should be different. There is a lot of difference in how SMS is sent. Are whatsapp-web is running a restaurant and he If he is making delivery then he should not do this. You should tell the chef to cook the same food. Follow the same systems, that's all Pack food for guests instead of serving them outside two. I shouldn't do this because I I know of many restaurants that do the same thing. If you follow then a little bit will do because if you like a restaurant then you will like its food also but if There is not as much focus as those who are doing OTT For. The method also suits the different sensibilities of the customers. It is available in the same brands also if you like I was just talking to my friend. We run the snitch so he was saying that when Snitch hey we made a case study on snitch. If yes then Sidharth drives the snitch I have good friends who say when When a customer needs to buy online. They look a little bit fashionable. I need a shirt that is shiny and which is impulse. Buy I am going to Goa for a holiday. So great for Goa. Get a shirt and the same is true when Snitch has an offline store. If I go and buy them then they get some plain. I need some vanilla. I mean one I want standard shirts. I want pants. If it lasts long, consumer behavior will also change which happens offline and online. Those who are ordering through delivery and those who are dine in I am eating it very interesting very. Interesting Vishal tell me one more thing.\n01:09:16 That's because you have 40 dine out outlets outlets and there are 110 delivery outlets. This is the location of 40 dining outlets. It's very crucial because as you said. He said that if your rent is in your Rent is a very big factor where But your rent can sometimes be on the 101 Or. If you have a very prime location. So sometimes it can go to 25 also, so at 25 if your revenue is going into something then you have to be very careful. In fact when we took this office then the most I felt more pained after watching this rant. What happened was after seeing the deposit and I understood that this is the work of doing the interior. It is such an expensive job and yet it there is business because after the business is set up I am spending this but. In case of restaurant, you have to pay the expenses first. Then you have to hope that. This location should be correct because if If you want to change the location then do that too. It is a very big process, so running a restaurant. The choice of location is very important. If it gets cruel then let me know if I have to. If you want to open a restaurant then I am a Prime How to choose location for a restaurant.Look, in this also, first let me tell you my case. If I give it to you, then like our 40 cities. There is a Bombay where there is no dine in Because the rent in Bombay is very high. Like if we go to Kanpur or go to Jalandhar or go to Guwahati or When we go to Masor we take dine in that the rent is not that high ₹1 square. Still available in ft and delivery. If you look at me also then 0.70 square feet Delivery is also required in cloud kitchen. So there is not much difference if tier two town I am where but you are from Bombay Delhi. If we talk about it then ₹ 50 per square foot square foot 00 square foot so that If it becomes prohibitive then there is a risk in it. If it grows too much then you have to be one to be careful about what you are doing. First I would say a little bit. If I can. First, you can start your business like a cloud kitchen. Let's start by seeing that the product. Is the market fit or not? Will the customers return? I am ordering, not doing it. Then you can. So if you dine in tier two, you will earn more. It is good like if you are in Dehradun. Do it in Jalandhar or Guwahati. Do this in Jamshedpur where even the rent is ₹1. If it is broken then there is more chance. Then you will get this You will have to decide in the mall. Doing it in the high street. What would you like me to recommend? It seems that the High Street is in every city. It is different, some malls are also such that There is palladium in Bombay, everybody go and get a second. These malls and high streets corner are differentiable. And what is the difference between the high street and It's like a mall, we are in the same mall. You have all your movie theaters as well as retail. There are also restaurants for eating and drinking food.There is a court also, so a customer who has come I have come thinking that I will find three or four. I have to spend hours and do shopping. Too. Maybe I want to see a movie and eat food too. What's in the high street but what's in the mall. He will also have to go down for parking. So it is not that he will bring that time. That evening he thought that I would eat for half an hour. If I come back after eating then he will go to the mall again. Will park just above not for him. Will go to the high street like what's that There is a Linking Road in Bombay and he has reached there. He parked the car and entered the restaurant if it goes then it mall has to be more planned behavior or if he's even going to the mall. But you got a captive audience that one who has come to the mall to watch a movie is shopping. If he has come to do it, he will definitely eat it, then you will One. The amount of rental to be paid is different. You have to do your own research and this rent will be such percentage of. How. Much revenue will be generated in Ideally Dine? Should not be more than 15 per cent, whichever This is your monthly rent, you can calculate it. Take it and see if you like it. You can do business if you basically if you. If rent is 1.5 lakh then business is worth 10 lakh Minimum. You should do. We got it and what would you recommend mall or high Street where rent is low. Where rent is low yes and it depends from city to city. Very good business in any mall. It happens somewhere on the high street too. But the High Street is a bit much for me. It is easy because the customer has to take care of parking etc. It would have been a little easier to get in and quickly goes out got it okay so you said how to choose a.The first thing in the restaurant is that this. See if there is product market fit. Only after that you can start your restaurant business. Enter because if you have seen this in cloud kitchen. If you have checked then you will find a restaurant. You will surely get the other one directly don't come to mumbai because you are not there. First of all in Mumbai that from tier two city start so if you are around mumbai. So first try Pune and then try Goa Try Nagpur Nashik where if your client tale and product. If it is like that then it is quite a counter-intuitive. There are two things because if someone in mumbai. If he stays then he will think that my The restaurant should be in Mumbai only, otherwise you will have to go to Mumbai. I can do it too but you will need a rented can kill you in this business. Then you have to be. Be more careful and your option remains later. Is it in the mall or the high street here where There should be less rent. There. Also, there your rent should be less or your product market fit if you. A captive audience is needed to watch the film I have come for shopping and I have entered your house. Mall is good if you want to expand your business. I have confidence that they will come only for you high speed ok perfect ok cool.The last question I want to ask you is. You told such an interesting thing in fact Dheeraj sir who came and played Jumbo King. He also started a brand and did the same thing. Told that there are so many categories in India where there aren't brands like they. Create your own brand of burgers. You are creating a brand in Biryani and Kababs. What is very interesting in butter chicken. Crazy kebabs are being made in a single kebab. The company is also very fond of Crazy Kababs. I'm more anxious to see that Where will all these brands be in the next 510 years will go as you said that India's soft the power is increasing. We are adding another Trillion dollars to our economy. Soon ever and fingers crossed we're up for a how kist growth to where do you see biryani buy kilo in the next 10 years to we Believe that right. Now we are worth 300 crore rupees. I think our plan is to reach 1000 in 3 years. We cross the revenue of crores and After that a hockey stick curve will come because we will be going from next year. People are going outside India also because wherever you guys got to know Biryani Kabab North Indian Food very big. The category is butter chicken dal etc. And we It was sanitized like a domino Has Pisa been sanitized or has it been McDowell Brother, anyone can get the burger sanitized can be made if these systems process is followed. If we keep doing it we have many masters. Franchise inquiries are very large from FNB companies which is a food company. KFC's master franchisees are middle In the East or Australia or Burger. They're all coming to us from King's We like biryani and kebab in our countries. If you want to take it then please help us. We think we will be here in 10 years. Mcdonald's is in probably 150 countries or KFC in 120 countries, 150 in 10 years. We think that we are in 15-20 countries. We will go and we should be 4 5000 crores. Company by than insane in have you started Giving on franchises to India we. We have a lot of franchisees outside India. Master is talking to people Franchisee Country Specific Got It Thank You. You are so huge I will tell you quickly. I've made so many notes.I don't usually show it to people. But I made a lot of notes I could quickly. I am surprised at what I have I learned it and if you feel somewhere that If I said something wrong please correct me Correct it first, we talked about it top. There are five categories in cloud kitchens. We spotted Biryani Kebab Pizza North Indian ice cream and a burger too. I would say this and one of the burgers are very big. Sushi is an upcoming category. The category is Chinese, it is a very big category. Then we saw that it wasn't like that that this will run for you all over India. In the North and West, as you said, In the North and West, as you said, Bonavita runs and in the South and East like You said that Horlicks is popular, so people.\n01:16:46 It is very important to see the test after. In we saw that cloud kitchen is Which way should you choose then you. Tell me three parameters of delivery. If your product is on your cloud reaches your customer from the kitchen. Its quality will degrade in any way. There should not be any material, it has become textured. Its taste is done, its flavour is done. Nothing should degrade second thing. You told me that the test for that region. What is that, you'll have to find out. You will find out by doing on-ground research. Later we talked about standardization. You told me about it in the test also. There are types of research, one of which is macro. Research that you about which there are two types of Standardization is one so the input is done. Standardization became the second process Standardization Input Standardization. I you told you that your Central Every restaurant should have procurement or for each cloud kitchen. You have your own. Procurement should not be dependent on him. You should have quality checks so that your. The same products which are procured should be procured and of the same quality. The products are procured and later we Saw process standardization where In every process you gave it a break. By downgrading, for every process you have done one such I have set up a system where two 200 grams Rice means you will have to add only 200 grams of rice spices means only this much spices have been added if If your date is expiry then do it before that spices will be used for which you have returned. If you have created processes then these processes I have come, your quantity is done. Standard process has been followed. The hygiene was done with it, it expired.You can use this AI systems, AI camera and your which audit systems. Feedback and QR codes and Customer feedback is what drives all these systems. By using it you find out that your. Are the processes being followed or not? If yes, If it is happening then is it happening properly or not. Happening accurately at the microscopic level whether or not it is and even if it is. Your customer. Data says that from 0.5 More complaints came. Above 5 means V Put a red line yes if people are over 55. If you are complaining then you get deeper into it. It is you who conduct an audit and you who make the systems and processes are in place. Then We Venture Towards Restaurant Versus Cloud Kitchens and What We Understood That There Are Three Major Parameters of Expenses That We need to consider for a restaurant which is labor cost food cost rent labor cost. Your food cost will be 28 from 9 to 18 to 35 and your rent will be 10. How much did you say the rent is 10 to 15 per kg? Cost will be Rs. 28 to 35 and labour cost will be. This is a little something at Verus Cloud Kitchen from 9 to 18. Your labor cost will reduce a bit. It is done at 8 to 9 and service is done. There is no staff, your food cost. It is approximately 30 to 35 cms and Your rent also decreases which reaches from 4 to 5. But here Pay your Swiggy and We looked at the pros and cons of having a After cloud kitchen we talked to celebrities.About the restaurants where we observed that customer acquisition and customer Retention is two important variables. And if there is a celebrity then the customer. It will help you a lot in acquisition will give because if Shilpa Shetty or Virat If Kohli opens a restaurant then he will. There is innate curiosity due to which The customer will say that I am trying this for the first time I will try it and only if you. If they are not fed good food, they will return. They will not come, that's why celebrity only solves it. For Customer Acquisition Not For Customer Retention of celebrity lounge. The wit of career is the essence of that entire career. They will give you acquisitions in a span of 10 years. I will help you with that if you. If you made a brand then nothing like it but yes. If you have put operations above quality. Not kept consistent or product market. If it doesn't fit, the customer won't come back again.Perfect, we will talk later, Biryani bye Kilo or in general a Biryani Cloud Kitchen about where we talked about that from 50 70 lakhs if you need Systems & processes ranging from all AI-enabled cameras. If you want to keep everything in check, even QR codes. If you want to keep it then you have to invest 50 to 0 lakhs. You will have to spend your working capital. That normal cloud kitchen is available for Rs. 15-10-15. Lakh can do it in 10-15 lakh also. Whatever your working capital may be should. It be one week's worth of sales which is healthy enough and what ever you can work on credit system so your working. The capital will be minimized significantly. If your rent is going up to ₹ lakh then you Minimum revenue of ₹ lakh per month. It will happen because your thrush hold is. The cost of the restaurant is ₹ lakh. For example, if your rent is ₹ lakh then your Revenue should be ₹ Lakh and cloud kitchen. If your revenue is ₹1 lakh then your Which is not the case if the cloud kitchen has rent at 5. So if the revenue is Rs. 10 lakh then Rs. 50,000. If the rent is Rs 10 lakh then it should be Rs 10 lakh. If you have revenue then 50 thousand is your rent. After that we saw that biryani Bay Kilo also runs its own app which is also a great thing because you save yourself 25 30 on commissions and but for that you have to take care of your delivery which is not very cost. If You Achieve Scale If You Do Not Achieve Scale then unit economics will eat it so it is. It is important to first go through Zomat and Swiggy and then you can get in to and then you can have your own puppy.Then we saw that If you want to start a cloud kitchen then. It has some parameters, first of all, that until you see product market fit. Until the product does not have market fit, No need of any thing, be it cloud kitchen or a restaurant, we saw that ok if you think cloud. Kitchen is this. It will work and if you have product market. If you want to open a restaurant after fitness then Open in tier two, not in tier one. Because the rent is very high at the end. In this business rent can kill you. Then we Went Towards Location Choice at a Macro scale where we have mall and high street you Seder Dining for Dining. If you have the confidence that people will only come for you then you choose high street if You think your at the Disbury Mall. If your stay increases then you should go to the mall. A captive audience is definitely available. The audience has come to see the picture you will find where you can do that but 15 but this is enough to pay your rent.If it is more than 15 or 16 then The problem is correct the rent as a percentage of Sales rent as a percentage of sales hum to We want to make India and Bharat proud. Like today McDonald's and Burger King and We are a big change in the domino world. I want biryani and kebabs to be of India. Which is a great dish and North Indian Cuisine and the rest of the Indian food, we I was able to take it to the world and many more Big changes at that level in the whole world. Mcdonald's and kfc 100 more today in We want that in more countries. In the next 1015 years we will eat this Indian food I can also take it to 1010, 5050, 10,000 countries And Make India and Bharat Proud Beautiful Beautiful and another very important thing You told the rest of the people that if You want to start a cloud kitchen, it's a Great times in the next few 10 years. If you are very good with systems and processes because of three reasons number one India is very high density. The Chinese are Way ahead and we are now about to reach the Chinese hockey stick growth is for us. There is a huge opportunity in India. The state that is when it comes to tier two Cities It Is Still Quite Underrated. Because of which you can still get in and the The frequency of dining out in India is Far less as compared to the likes of Eating Out in Singapore and Other Countries. And delivery will increase a lot, right. Now it is fancy. If the category increases then buy it yourself. Due to increased density we will have to scale. If you get the scale, you will get many. There are benefits where unit economics You will become better because of which you You can earn profit from this podcast Summary of Thank You No."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 So gas here you can't see that this strategy has given us rewards up to one or 10 here. Here you can clearly see that in the original strategy so many stop losses are being hit here. But according to the modification we did, not even a single stop loss is being hit so finally gas one of the most requested videos of this channel. The modified version of the 9 and 15 study has finally come today and again so sorry gas you all had to wait. So long for this video. I was a little caught in the short so it got so late anyway today. Finally the modified version of the 9 and 15 strategy we will understand in detail and let me tell you gas. This is going to be one of the most powerful modified strategy of this channel. Now you will ask that simply because in this modification we have specially added some very powerful candle stick patterns which reduce almost every time.Such pattern is 950 m We will add it to the strategy and not only this, we will also add such secret indicators with settings in this modification which you will hardly find on the story. In the entire YouTube, exactly gas, that is why you cannot miss this video at all and gas, do not skip the video and watch it. Because every part of the video is going to be important, if you skip and watch it, you will not understand anything, take out time and watch the entire video, okay, so let's not talk much, let's get started, so gas, here I have got a bank signal strategy wise in the original line and 15, so the red line that you can see here is nine one and the black line that you can see is 15M, the slope of both is different and here a police candle has been formed by touching 9M, so this is the condition of the original strategy, so we got the signal here, so what will we do, whenever there is a break of this green police candle, we will make an entry here and we call. This green candle as an alert candle, okay. So this will become an alert candle. As per the original strategy, the top loss of this alert candle will become low and we will take the target of one of these two, now let's see what happens next and gas here our stock plus has flown because if you look carefully here, here an M pattern has formed which is a double top pattern, so the strategy has failed here and gas I have shown you this example. Because you will find thousands of such fake signals in the charts where our small strokes get wasted, we will try to filter these stop losses with today's modification, so gas let's understand the notification. Now, gas before understanding the modification, we will have to understand the original streets once quickly, so this original 9 and 15 rule strategy was first. Introduced to us.By the owner of the Trade Room YouTube channel, you must check out his channel, so you have a channel named Trade Room, in his channel on YouTube too, you will get to see a lot of very good learning videos. You can learn from there, so don't forget to check out his channel, you should definitely check out his channel as well. So look, in the conditions that Sir had given us for the bike, the first condition is simply that there will be a line in nine A. Okay, let's hold this nine M, below that our. A will go 15 M, okay, 15 M should not be above nine M for the bank, okay, always above 15 M 9 M. What was the first condition, the second condition, the slope of 9:15 M, that is your 30 degree angle, it should be more, give a greater 30 degree angle, now see, this is a subjective thing, okay, what may be 30 degrees for me, may be 25 degrees. For someone else, it may be 20°, right, so this is totally subjective, so we will ignore it, okay, what we will see, simply the two lines should remain, okay, for upward bank, upward and for selling, the two lines should be strong downloads, okay. This will take some practice. At first you might not understand from the size but it is very easy. Simply you have to see whether that line is strong up or both. The lines are strongly downward. If both the lines are flat like this then you should not trade at all. Now what is the condition of slope here?What is the next condition when the price touches nine here and forms a strong Police candle. That Police candle becomes our alert scam. Then when the next candle breaks the high of the blue candle, we make an entry there. This is the normal original streets of 9 and 15 m. These are its simple conditions. Along with that there are other conditions like Police candles, how did you tell others? First of all there was a big body candle and another candle stick, that is your big bar candle. So it looks something like this. My drawing is very bad but I have seen these three candlestick patterns. Most of the time it gets full, especially in small type. Okay, I am not saying that it does not reduce, most of the time it swells up, most of the time it swells up, that is why we will add such a pattern. Also, we will add it in modification right. Now, I will tell you everything right. Now, okay do not skip the video, I will tell you a very important thing here, so that candlestick pattern we will add, along with that. We will also add two indicators because it will give us more confirmation, okay, so let's see them now, but there is one more thing because I forgot to tell you and there is a condition, I had told us, okay, late it is 9 am, 15 am, from the open, a strong balls candle breaks both of them from below.Like this, even then it becomes our alert canal, okay and it can reduce the streets from here. Also, but gas, when I personally tested it, it fails most of the time, okay, whenever it reduces, it gives a very big gap, when it does not reduce, it can also give you a strong stop loss, because see your stop will be. Here, the entry will be here, so for now we will not leave it. We are disincluding it. Okay, this break out condition of 915 M. Now, the break out from below, we will not see this condition for today's video.Okay, I have specifically told you the reason, but if you want to see this as well, then I am going to bring part two of this video. If you complete 1000 likes in this video and at the same time go to the comment and write a small yes. Okay, just write this much. Then I will also bring part two of this video. In part two, I will try to bring some solution for this break out condition as well. So you have to complete 1000 likes. Go to the comment and write this like this.\n05:17 Now, for gas ceiling, it is very simple. Whatever I said, its opposite will be right. Okay, it will be below nine. 15 will be above. For bank, it was above nine. 15 was below. The slope in both, you just have to see that there should be a strong slope on the right side. Okay, the stronger the slope, the stronger yours will be.Chances are created, okay and next, by touching the nine mark, whatever we saw on the bullet standard, you have to see the opposite of that, simply such a candle and whenever its low breaks, then our no entry exit happens, for stop loss, here the stop loss is done, its high and the target is for both, for selling and buying, we normally take 1 2. Because this is a scalping strategy, okay, so gas, here are our original conditions, okay, the original strategy, now the modification that we understand by going to the chart, so here. In this, I have gone to the five minute chart of Nifty and here we understand the modification, here see this red line is our 9 mark and this black line is ours, but now ask what is this arrow for, okay, what is this arrow that will be formed in the chart, so gas, you can see here on the top left side that I have added an indicator here, which is this nine mark.And 15M Strategy Auto Signal Indicator and by looking at the name you must be knowing what this indicator does, yes gas this indicator is automatic, it matches its conditions and automatically prints signals in the live chart, as you can see, these signals are printed. In the entire chart, when this green arrow is formed, it means that 9 and the slope is long, which means here it is upward for the bull and when this red arrow is formed in the chart, it means that the slope of 9:15M is in the strong down side and at the same time a very big nine is formed by touching A, only then it becomes an aeroplane, as you can see it here. On the example, along with this I have added these two more arrows, one is the blue arrow which is formed whenever it touches the nine A and a blue candle is formed, but the slope is not a strong slope, only then it becomes a blue arrow and there is a black arrow, when a Bearing scam is nine, it is formed by touching me, but the slope is not a strong slope, so now there is a black, that is also formed, you can turn all these on and off as you can see in the settings and this indicator prints very fast without any lag signals in the live market, as you can see in the screen. Now, whenever the conditions match, it prints it every day and especially for those who want to back test the strategy.Properly, it can be very easy to back test it, according to this indicator, if you go to do it. Manually, there is a lot of heading and gas gas what, you can also use this indicator, I have uploaded the code of this complete indicator in the membership of this channel, as you can see in the screen, from there you just have to copy the code and after copying, you have to go to your trading view and the option named Fine Editor will be found, here you have to open it and whatever existing code will be. There, you have to delete it. And the code that you copied, you have to paste it here and I will show you this indicator by cutting it, then you will see the add option here, just click on it, as you can see our indicator has been added here, so you can access the indicator very easily, so to join the membership, what you have to do simply is go to the bottom of this video and on the side of the subscribe button. There, you will see this blue color join button, click on it and from there you can join the membership and obviously this is a paid membership. Because I have put a lot of effort in making this indicator, that's why I have kept it inside the membership and you will not find only this indicator. Inside the membership, this is a small thing. Inside the membership, I add more premium indicators inside the membership.From time to time, you have already added this indicator, a 10 Yemen streets indicator was kept and this Nine and 15 is Yummy's new indicator and along with that you will get three master classes in the upcoming time and I will add master success there and in the master classes you will get everything from notes learning. So if you are a serious learner. Then you can definitely join the membership so the first modification here will be that we will first add the indicator here okay. First of all we have to simply add RSI. Okay RSI Relative Strength Index and here you have to go to settings. After going to settings you have to go to style and here all these will remain on all these tricks that you can see here will remain on you have to turn them all off only and only here you have to keep all of them on.\n09:14 Next you have to go to inputs the settings you have to do here look here you will find an option with time frame below by the way you will get to see. This only and only in trading view okay trading view is free. There is no need to pay any money. Now look here, click on the time frame option and after that what you simply have to do is whatever time frame chart you are using, you have to select its next time frame here. So for me here I am using the chart of my time frame, so for me the next time frame comes after 15 minutes, so I will select it and click OK here. Okay, now how do I do that, what do I have to see, friend, look.At this time, there is RSS, there is a lagging indicator here, but we have nothing to do with it. Okay, whether it is lagging or live indicator, it does not matter. Whatever alert candle you want to see here, leg here we can see. Inside this alert, this big select candidate which is slow, the slope of this I is very high, which is a very good sign. Okay, so here we are getting all the conditions. According to the original strategy, along with that for conformation we are using RSI, in RSI simply. You have to see that the alert candle that has been formed has to go down from the point to the point. You have to see the RSI at this point. So you can see that I have made a point straight and the line of RSI should show upward here. Just like our slope here is also upward, similarly your RSI here should also be upward. Like this, here we can clearly see that you have ADS and what is a bone. At this point, if RSI is upward even previously then it is even better.As you can see, here it has been constantly upward for a long time, so here we get a good signal. This was our number one indicator. Okay, number one indicator and you can use an indicator for confirmation, which is an optional indicator. You can add it if you want or you can not. Web Print Indicator: This comes from an original indicator whose name is Web Trade by Lazy Bear. I have modified it a little and designed my own indicator, which you can see. Here, there is only an oscillator, that is, if we talk simply, the line that you can see is called an oscillator, so you will find it here in the chart, here you will find almost all the web trade, but the line of the web trade is a smooth line and the line of the RSI is not smooth and is lagging, so what do you have to see in this indicator, just like we saw the direction of that point, here also you have to see the direction, if there is its direction, then we get a signal. Here, if there is a flat direction, we do not get a signal, if there is a direction in the DR side, we do not get it, this is a condition of the buy D way of the off side, okay and on the DR side. It will be exactly opposite, we have to see the condition of the DR side, that too we will see in detail later in the video, but I did not tell you from where you will get this indicator, this indicator which you will not get by searching because it is not uploaded in the trading view. Nor has it been uploaded, unfortunately, but no problem, this indicator comment Go to me and write the report.\n11:46 I will provide you a link. By clicking on that link, you will go to such a page. From here, you just have to copy this code. You have to go to your trading view and look below. Go to the fine editor. As I told you previously, remove all the code that remains and paste the copied code. Simply add it from here. Your indicator has been added here. It is that simple. You can do it as simply as you want. Just write the code in the comment. Just like I used to give you PTS in the previous video, you will get this code simply. So this is the part of our indicator. Now the most important part is our candlestick pattern. The indicator can be full. The price area is very rarely full. So it is very important to focus on candlesticks or the original price area. See, the pattern is police single feeling. Many of you will know and I personally use this pattern a lot. See what should be on the buy side.This alert handle is formed here. The previous candle of the candle should be a red candle. It should not be a green candle. It should be a red candle. And the alert candle of the red candle, as you can see. Here, this alert candle is going on. We should include it. See, the body of this red candle has gone inside the green candle. The low of the green candle is high. The high of the green candle is high. And the body of this red candle has gone inside the clean candle. This is called angle fee in the Gulf. So, if you look at this on the original example here, it is a bullish engulfing pattern. Look carefully. I can clearly see here that this is a bullish engulfing pattern because this green alert candle has angled the red candle.It has been done with a very small margin. But what is definitely there and This is our signal. Here, so gas, we got all the signals. Here, this alert also saw a girlfriend and the indicator which we have used. For two confirmations, we got positive signal in both of them, so if we had executed the signal in the next signal itself, we would have easily got a target, as you can clearly see, see here you will have to focus more on candlesticks than indicators. Because the signal can be much more powerful than candlestick and price action indicators and gas, nothing will happen. By just learning the candlestick pattern, you will have to understand the psychology of candlestick, you will have to understand how candlesticks are formed, in the long term, only. This will help you to be successful in trading, so guys, I have a gift for all of you.

By taking the premium plan, I know.By this point in the video, many people might have left the video but if you are still watching this video, it simply means that you have a passion to learn gas, which many people do not have at all. So keep this passion to learn and stay in the video. According to me, this part is the most important part of the video. Here I will show you some examples and will also try to explain the logic behind it. So let's see the first example. Here we get to see two signals. This is the first signal which has come as per the original strategy. As you can see, the new one is facing downwards and at the same time it is also at 15 and is also creating a good slope here. And the candle is also a variety candle but we did not see any angle fang pattern here. And today I said before gas, when a girlfriend is formed, it is very good, but you see the candle behind this candle, what is this? Resolution regarding this. This pattern was small. Inside the green, this red candle was completely destroyed and at the same time it broke the 15MA and 5MA from above, so there is no need to look at any indicator. Here, I will make an entry.Here, let's say from late to max, this angle fine candle, this red candle, whenever there is a break, which is to be seen. In this white candle, this candle breaks, an entry is made here and look, there are two types of stock loss. Here, one is here, the stop loss is almost 20 points, which is not right according to scalping, so look carefully. Here, this next candle was also an entry candle, here the entry is missed, so we could have made an entry here also, so if this is an integrated one, then we can also keep a stop loss of scam, so here there will be a stop loss of only 5 points, so here if I take such a small problem, you can see a big move one x to six, sometimes. So this was the first example, after that we have also seen a second trade, there is no variation. In it, very single trend which was formed here has gone very far. From there, okay, okay that is it, what is the role of the indicator. Now, you can see our alert candle, below this alert candle, see once what is the RSI showing, hey sign is flat, what does it simply mean, here our trade did not get conformation, look here the stock plus our back goes, there is a very big stop loss saving because now if the entry is made here, okay, at this point and the stop loss was band till here, then you can see how big stock loss.\n18:03 It can take because now we see this example, here we got a police signal simply because you can see that the 9 one is a strong momentum and at the same time the 15 one is also in an award lock, so the indicator has printed it automatically. Here, if you do not use the indicator. You are doing it, you can also see them manually, there is no problem, but for the sake of doing it on time and for the sake of not making the video too long, I am using this auto signal indicator so that it is easy to understand. So here the second thing we have to see is the angle pattern, or not. Here the close of the red candle has also been angled by this police candle, so we will do it, is it a pattern. The second thing we have to see is the indicator today, usually see it on this side, along with this there is a web print indicator, it is on the website, date mains, here you get all three confirmations and from here see how much India had a move, but the market had closed.Here, still a small move was found here, now see this example, here it is 9:00 M and 15 M, both have a very good slope, but see this. Carefully, a bullish candle has formed, there is also a red candle. Before it, which has been angled by this police candle, it means obviously an angle fine pattern. This is being formed, look at the second thing directly, it is a very good word and the wow trade is their jitter, you can definitely see that one is showing you the direction, the trade that you get from here. In the long term, so brother, this trade started from here and it went, meaning it is still going on, actually if you look carefully and its previous. Also, you can also see this example, look here. Once, no police has been formed but everything else is fine, see the 915 is differently in the slope, all of you are words, there are many words but do not make any angle fan pattern, but here it is a very interesting pattern, this is also a pattern and we get to see other strong patterns. Like this, okay, this also saves a lot of time, we will not be able to know all the patterns. In this one video, it will take a lot of time, but we will learn a lot in part two, so definitely complete 1000 likes for part two and go to the comment and write.Yes, see lastly I will tell you this I would like to show you a very interesting example, you will get to see a lot of things in the chart which can be a little annoying as well but listen to me. Carefully, these lines, these boxes which you can see and these lines which you can see, these levels and zones are important syllabus of the market and listen, from here, whenever the market came. In this zone, there was a total shuffle from here and at the same time, when it came to this zone, it actually crossed the support level from here and again moved a short. Now, okay, now from which base have I drawn this, so normally locking. The levels becomes every strategically important, how to draw, from late I am. In 5 minutes, now I have kept a 5 minute chart open, I will go to one over time frame, okay, after that, first of all, all the indicators that you have kept have to be turned off and just look at the chart. Once and in the chart of Nick, we have to do a very simple level, so if You can search on YouTube and you will find many videos, it is a very easy concept but if I tell you simply, then you see.\n20:51 These are the points from where the price has taken rejection or support, like support was taken. Here, a point has been formed. Here, okay, a point has been formed. In this point, a point has been formed. Here, similarly a point has been formed. Here, a point has been formed. Here, you just have to connect such points by creating them, I am not going into details in today's video, but this is the simple concept of doing level stock, so look carefully. Here, I had told the previous editor that this is a zone, for a long time Nifty was doing a drop up in this support zone, meaning, taking direction from here, support was laid here and from here support was taken and then it went to this level and again taking rejection. Here, it went to take support in the lower zone and you can see study wise, we have got entry everywhere in this resistance zone. Entry has been found as you can see here a lot sir and entry has been found here in the supports on.Also, if you see previously also, entry has been found here everywhere, so when such entries are found, accuracy becomes quite simple because support resistance A which is simply price action is being included with the strategy, see if you are getting complications in understanding it, it's okay, this is normal, you will have to give some time in the market, okay, everything will be learned automatically and I know these strategies are a bit complicated. But if you watch this video twice, you will understand everything, take some time and see, all your doubts will be cleared, no, the example here was what was the example there, so see from here, support take here. We have been given two entries, first this entry, second this entry in which we did not get to see the whole in both these entries, but if you get to see any one price action, then according to the thoughts in and price area, if you look here a little carefully.So we can see a little bit of a double bottom or blue pattern here and what do we know that when a double bottom is formed near the support zone, it is a great opportunity right, that is exactly what has happened here, along with that we have got the cream of strategy and here also see that it is showing upward, see point wise. This is an alert candle, in this point both parts are showing, its previous alert, here also both indicators are there, so here you can understand like price action confirmation, so here you can see very good trades, like we got to see the trade that was seen here, if you did scalping. Obviously it would have been a small trade, but for those who are long holders, once you are 11, you can see an award. There, a small stock plus a big trade, so you have to see such conformations, okay and focus a lot on candlesticks, so gas that free course of candlesticks that I told you, you must watch it, that is totally okay. It is free, you will get to know the basics of candlesticks. From it, you can also modify it by yourself by learning all these basic concepts in your own strategy.\n23:21 Like candlestick patterns, I hope you understand it, you must have heard the name of Chai PPT, if you have not heard, then this is a Atul which is creating a lot of buzz right now, in trading also we can do a lot by using Chai PPT, literally we can do a lot, so now you will get to see a video on the right side, in it I have told in detail how we can take advantage in trading by using Chai PPT, that is, by using this Chai PPT, so you can watch that video. By clicking here, it is a very interesting video and today's video ends. Here, for part 2, definitely write yes in the comment and if you have not subscribed to the channel, then definitely do so because you can get part two. Only then. And if you are a serious learner and you also like this indicator, then you can also subscribe to the channel membership right now you can join so that's it today gas. I hope you liked the video thanks but watching see you in the next video please you."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 Hi this is PR Sundar Welcome to this special episode where I'm going to talk about uh the medium-term outlook for our markets. Uh maybe from now to December maybe 8 9 months right. Uh we will be looking at both some uh news flow. Uh they are not exactly fundamental analysis but you know strategic news and this and that and plus we also look at the technical analysis. Uh let me go to the computer straight away. Now. So this is the daily chart of nifty. Uh I'll just give you some uh small background uh what has happened in 2023 around the end of October. So there are some small correction hit some lowest point uh lower point around 19,000. What has actually happened during the next wonder of year. There was a very very fantastic rally maybe 2 years and Nifty moved from around 19,000 to uh 26,300 that was a 7,300 point rally. So that's almost 40% rally in a matter of one and a half years. The rally was triggered by two major events and one the Fed chairman's announcement that going forward the interest rates will go down in US and second one uh after winning major state elections uh in November 2023. The expectation that BJP will be winning the parliament election in 2024. So this expectation of BJP and uh US Fed chairman's announcement regarding the uh rate cut. So that start started and triggered a huge rally. That huge rally went nonstop from 19,000 to 26,300 around there. What has happened at that point of time. Uh maybe you know this markets rallied because of you know uh even due to many negative points.Also sometime in February last year you know finance. Minister has presented one of the worst budget in terms of stock market because she increased the ST. She increases. She increase the short-term capital gain tax. She increase the long-term capital gain tax so she increase the ST. Then you know indexation.\n02:49 Benefit was taken taken out for many asset classes you know so but despite that you know the rally you know that's what I always say if you are traveling in a car with 100 km speed. Even if you apply a brake okay. It won't stop there you know it will move another 10 20 m and 10 20. Ft. Then only it will stop so that's why this more powerful rally from 19,000. You know even when there some bad news came so you know it did not stop. There it moved further higher and then at some point of time. So FA felt no enough is enough and this is you know too big rally. The Indian valuations are so high. In this period you know only the nifty moved 40%. There are many many stocks like PSU stocks you know they all moved in a five time 10 time 20 time. You know uh like you look at some PFC look at uh BC. Look at Magon talk no RJBNL. So many there are so many public sector companies. BSC is not a public sector. You know so they all shot up like five time 10 time you know unreasonable valuation. Then they thought you know okay. Now it is time to book the profit No FA can invest in any market in the world. Why should they invest here then they started selling here.So this is a very very major correction Okay Nifty has fallen nearly 4,000 point. So therefore this is already a medium term. So we are looking at last 6 7 months picture. So to forecast next six 7 months picture. So therefore know this is uh a fair level. So we take from here. So first let us look let us look at this chart. So market peaked out around this place. Then correction came. So it corrected up to this point Okay. Now what I do I'll draw a Fibonacci retracement. So from this level to this level Okay So if you look at this Fibonacci retracement level. Okay I may not try accurately but a little bit here and there is okay. So the markets actually fallen from uh around 26300 to 2300. So that is about uh uh around 3,000 point.\n05:25 Now what happened then there was some recovery. So this recovery you know where this recovery ended you see okay. Uh this is a 50% Fibonacci retracement and see. This is where the recovery ended. As I gave you the story of a car. You know even apply break. It won't stop exactly so it won't exactly reverse from 50% and a little bit that only an intraday and on a closing basis there was only one day Nifty closed above this 50% Fibonacci retracement. Next day started falling right okay. So uh in a technical analysis. This 50% Fibonacci retracement is considered to be a very very important level.Right so 3,000 point fall 1,500 point rally and exactly at uh this uh this point you know it has uh reversed this level. Okay So exactly reversed and reversed. Once it has reversed it should not break this low. What has happened you know it came down crashing down and it broke this level. That is a sign of bearishness. And then you see from that level. The market has fallen even more Okay. So this is a uh nearly 4,000 point fall. Then what happened now the market reversed Okay. Once it reversed at least this should be a resistance. So this is around 23300. So you may remember in my YouTube channel. Many times I talk about 23300 was the resistance resistance you know. So that has taken out. So now that has taken out the market moved higher. Now it is correcting a little bit or we can say it is consolidating. Now if you look at the bigger fall from here to this low. Okay I'll just drag this number this picture to this level. So if you look at from this level to this level now if you look at the 50% Fibonos retracement. So that is coming around uh 24,136 or we can say 24100 to 24150. So this is the major resistance Okay Right.\n07:57 Now there is a peak here. It came down so much now reverse. So this is you know some people are thinking that you know so. This is a kind of a double top Okay. So because people think that this is kind of a double top some some kind of a profit booking is coming. So that is why I said you know if the market has to sustain the rally. The first this level has to be taken out Okay that is the recent high of 23869. So this is what I've been telling in my YouTube channel. So once this 23300 has taken out okay uh I said then that becomes the support now. So now the support is 23300. The resistance is uh short-term resistance is the recent high of 23,869. But once that is taken out okay then there's this double double top is will not work any longer than the fibon fibonus retracement. So in a longer time frame the market fell 50% retracement again fell very big now inching towards the 50% retracement. So my opinion is that you know uh 24150 is going to be a very very important resistance. So if that is taken out okay then the next resistance is 24 uh 650 and then next one is uh 25 400 and then final one is a 100% retracement but given that uh the Trump uncertaintity so if you analyze the US market is working something. Like this.Uh markets fell after the Trump. Uh tariff thing started but that was not a long-term that's a short term markets fell then for one week 10 days. Trump was keeping quiet recovered now again he started talking. Now it fell and broke that day's low okay so now. On April 2 people are waiting what Trump is going to talk and there are many other things are going on in a global markets okay so uh what is happening for the next few trading session. Maybe at least for one to two weeks. Uh things are not certain so there are so many uncertaintities are there so technically if you are watching.\n10:34 24150 is going to be a resistance and until then I will maintain my bearish view because for the last few months I've been maintaining my bearish view. Once nifty crosses 24150 closes about 24150 at least for a day or then I will turn bullish. My bearish view is gone. Although market has fallen you know although market has recovered uh nearly 1,800 points but still we are not bullish. You are only looking at the nifty. If you look at the midcap small cap you know broader market okay. I think somewhere I read still you know about. Uh 75% of the stocks are in death cross death. Cross means you know 50-day moving. Average is below 200 day moving average so the stock wise you know. Things are not looking good okay and there are lot of uncertaintities going on especially from uh US administ ation. So they all will take some time to subside. So maintain uh bearish view until Nifty crosses 24150 and then you can have a bullish view. So that is a short message. This is based on the uh you know Fibonacci retracement levels. Of course you can also look at death cross golden cross. You can look at other technical parameters right uh so this is just one because I'm a mathematician. So fibonosi uh fibonosy sequence comes from mathematics only. So therefore I tend to believe this fibonosy more and then always remember.Technicals are just only a guideline. So there is no guarantee that this will work always. It all depends upon what time frame you take you. Know. I took last October as a starting point. You know things can be different right. So nobody can be very very accurate. So we are talking only about the probabilities. We are not talking about the uh certaintities right. So now the Trump is talking about tariff against India that's likely to affect automo likely to affect paraceutical likely to affect uh you know uh IT stocks right. And funny thing is that you know in normal beer market. Normal downtrend market FMCG stocks will do well but this time FMCG stocks are the one falling more right. So things are all changing you know the people say that you know uh rural demand is going down uh number of middle- class people coming down in India. You know the people are struggling you know all kinds of so more. I talk then it becomes more political so let us not go into that okay so we restrict only our discussion to uh stock market right. So I can tell you even now uh don't be surprised by.\n13:40 You know few days of FIA buying because they've been selling consistently for last 6 months you know suddenly for 6 days. They buy you know things do not change from the longerterm perspective so in a long-term perspective or medium-term perspective uh. It is there so then you may ask one question sir what is the point of discussing all these things right okay uh all those who are thinking you know what is the point of discussing all these things okay go and check you know uh like somebody who sold uh. Let us say anything like 22,000 put option and 26,000 call option in December expiry. Uh about few months before see what is a quick pandle or maybe 6 months before right so you know uh. If you know the medium-term view you can also uh do some kind of a uh trade in the longer term. Okay. Maybe I will just show you one more thing Okay I log into my after account Okay. So this is just a paper portfolio Uh I did not do this trade to be very honest with you. I did the trade. After the I came back. I came out Look at this trade which was taken on 31st October Okay for the March series. That means what october November December January February March I've taken a 6 months view and that time I've taken a bearish view because I took a bearish view.I bought 26,000 put option. Then but I'm not an option buyer. If my view goes wrong I will lose money. So I financed it by selling a double. The quantity 24,000 put option. And then anyway I'm bearish. I sold a call option. Also Right March series ended already. So you want to analyze that trade Okay. This is a pay of chart. So that means your loss will be below 22,000 and above 26,000. So because when I did this Nifty was around 25,000.\n15:50 So I was bearish. So that's why I've done it. Okay. Now look at the total P&L uh. The margin was around 2 cr. Or maybe. Even you take it as 2.5 cr because now exper is over. They are not reflecting the margin even if you have taken uh 2.5 cr as the margin and you your profit was like how much uh like 1 cr. 23 lakhs so that's almost 50% return in how many months 6 months right so that's almost 8% return per month. Right okay of course here you seeing the picture uh end picture only right so in between what was the MTM loss and this and that you know I can show but then it will take very very long time okay maybe if you know how to use the uh option simulator in obstra you can go and do it yourself right but look at the funny thing I bought put option that has given 81 lakh rupees. Profit I sold 24,000 that has given uh 9 9 lakh 63,000. Both buy put also gave profit sell put also gave profit sell. Call also gave profit so all of them are profit but this is a combination of you know this is not a strangle. This is not a option buy so it's a combination of some strategies uh which normally we teach in our workshop right so maybe if you are interested to know these kind of strategies you may consider attending our workshop Right. So once again I tell you disclaimer I'm not a SEB registered REA or IA okay. This is just for education purpose and I also told you that this is a paper trade right.\n17:37 No so just I'm giving the example you know. Many people think you know sir what is the point of discussing what is going to happen 6 months down. The lane medium term. What is the point of talking medium-term and you know what is going to happen in the short term. But I'll tell you the people who have a good view and you know who trade in medium-term to long-term. They make much better return than the short-term traders because you know short-term. It's very difficult to predict the market. So that's why people say you know. Uh seasons can be predicted but weather cannot be predicted right. So more or less you know 6 months one year down. The lane where the market will be going. One can judge more or less but very very difficult to judge uh the short-term things right. So I think I've taken enough time so I will look for another opportunity to discuss some other topic hope you enjoyed watching. This video thank you for watching."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 So finally you guys came to the video, the video you were waiting for, option trading. Today you are getting very motivated that you have to trade in options. You see that people are making big profits by buying Options. In fact, you are seeing that option sellers have also become very active. So what is this option trading? Even today many people do not know the basic concept. So in this video, we will assume that you guys have to learn basics and we will go from the basic level because the upcoming videos are going to give you advanced concepts very quickly. So it is very important to clear the basics before learning advanced. So let's understand options.See what happens is that we have heard from childhood that people buy stocks. So you must have heard that someone bought Airlines, bought Tata, bought ITC, bought Bajaj, bought TVS Motor, bought MRF, bought Pedal Lite, bought a lot of stocks. So stocks always increase. You tell me that stocks always increase because if you have bought, then you will only get profit when the stock goes up. But you must have also heard that the stock market has been corrected, the correction has come, it will be that the stock market has sunk, it has broken, the stocks have broken, so what at that time? So you feel that there is a loss here. It can happen that if we have invested money, then we can also have a loss. So what is the protection of this loss? It is very important to understand its protection. So what are the options? When people talk, why did the options come? First of all, they came for hedging. Today you and I will buy a stock of 1 lakh, 2 lakh, 3 lakh, 10 lakh, 1 crore, 2 crore, 10 crore, but our limit will come after that. But you think how many people like us who invest through SIPs. You are doing SIPs continuously every month. So there are hedge funds in the market that are managing people's money. Now why do we call hedge funds a hedge fund? Because they are putting money in the market, but they keep hedging against your money. Correct. That if the market has sunk, it has broken, someday. It will happen that someday the market will break, it will crash. So that you people do not suffer in the crash situation. So what is hedging?Let's understand it today. If a person trades, then you have two options in the options. There is a call option and a put option. If we have an option in both, then before explaining this, call is called CE, put is called PE, call European, put European, because we deal in European contracts, we do not deal in American contracts. So we have European options. So you buy a call, who can call? So any stock that trades on F&O, what is F&O? F&O means future and options. So now we are talking about options, but there is something called futures also. What is futures? That you get leverage. Now all these things that I am saying, maybe you are not understanding someone at once. So the video is available on the internet, you can watch it as many times as you want. So leverage means, now I have to explain leverage once, taking a little time. See where does it start from?It starts from here that we are basically interested in buying stocks. You simply want to buy. You have 1 lakh rupees. You have 1 lakh rupees, you want to buy, you went and bought a stock of 1 lakh rupees. Now let's assume that the stock increased by 5% in a day. So how much profit will be there, Riyash? 5,000. 5,000 will be the profit. We are removing charges and all. We have a profit of 5,000. 5% has increased. But Riyash says that what will happen to me with 5,000? I have 1 lakh rupees, but I need 25,000 rupees. How will 25,000 come? So if it only increased by 5%, then you will say that this is not possible. If a stock increases by 5% and 1 lakh rupees will be bought, then 5,000 will come, not 25,000. But there is an option. So before going to the options, let's understand the future option. So what do you say to your broker? Give me the future. So what will he say in the future? Okay, I am ready to give you 3 times or 5 times leverage. What does leverage mean? You will give me a margin of 1 lakh. What is the margin? The money you keep with your broker. Now what happened to the broker?\n04:34 If you have opened your Demat account. Somewhere, then you put funds in the Demat account. The fund that is used is used like a margin. So if you do not have a Demat account yet, you will get the link of the free Demat account in the description box. You can go and open your free Demat account. Now you have a Demat account. So if you have a Demat account, then what will you write there?For example, you write Reliance, then you will write FUT in front of Reliance. So Reliance has a future. Now in the future, I am explaining the future before explaining the options because many people will hear F and O at the same time and they will not understand the future. So in the future, you have 3 types of expiry. One is the current month's expiry, one is the next month's expiry, and one is the far month's expiry. So for example, the video I am making today is in May. So if you write Reliance FUT, then you will see an expiry of May, an expiry of June, an expiry of July. So as soon as you go and buy the future, suppose you bought the future in May, so what does expiry mean? You said that the future will also expire. This is a contract. So whenever we do a contract, we have a date. When will it end? So the date of its future is the last Thursday of the month. So the last Thursday in May, the last Thursday in June, the last Thursday in July, our future contract will expire. Now this also means that if 5% has increased today and I think it can increase tomorrow. As well, 2% 3% can also increase.So it is not necessary that I sell it today. I can also carry it. Now what is carry? Because if I am telling you carry here, because this thing comes before the future, intraday. One is to buy the stock, which we call taking the delivery of the stock. But you must have heard that many people are intraday traders, they trade intraday. So in intraday, they basically do 3 things. One is they trade direct intraday, second they trade in futures, third they trade in options. So what is intraday? Intraday means you have to buy the same day and sell the same day. But how will you get intraday? When you go to buy any stock, you simply go to buy Reliance. For 1 lakh rupees, your broker gives you the option that you have to buy. This stock in delivery or intraday. As soon as you go to buy in intraday, it will give you leverage. It will give you leverage depending on the broker. Now here comes one more thing in intraday, if you feel that this stock can fall by 5% today. Example, today I am making a video, if you saw yesterday, HDFC Bank fell by more than 5%. Now suppose your analysis was saying that HDFC Bank can fall and can fall by 5% and you had 1 lakh rupees, but you had to earn 25000. So what did you do here? You traded. In intraday, you traded for 1 lakh rupees. Now if you trade for 1 lakh rupees and we get leverage of 5 times, then how much money will we get in Reliance if 5% breaks?\n07:30 5 times 5 lakhs of 1 lakh, we will get 5% in that, it will be 25000. It will be 25000, it will be fun. But one more thing, if you turn out to be wrong, then the loss will also be on 5 lakhs. Correct. This happened in the same futures, but what happened in futures, you don't have to cut the deal. On the same day, you have time until the expiry and after the expiry, people's positions are roll over, so it is called roll over. Means people take it ahead, they feel that it is going on now. Suppose the market is going in uptrend, so they feel that it is going in futures, but the May contract is expiring, let's go in June. So this is known as roll over in the position. Let's move forward. Now we come to our options. Now if you go to buy futures, then you think more margin. This is a simple thing, you can check the margin. If you simply call or put to buy, then it takes very little margin. Let me tell you an example. In today's rate, we are giving a hypothetical example.Nifty is running at 18200 and you go to take the call option of Nifty, then you see that you are getting 100 rupees. One important thing here is that when you are going to buy options or you are going to buy futures, in intraday it is not necessary, but if you buy futures and options, then it is always bought in lots. What does lot mean? You will not get a share. So if Nifty is at 18200, and now we will understand the concept of add the money, in the money, out of the money, but if it is at 18000, then it is called add the money. Where there is a market, if you are taking a call or put of it, then it is called add the money. So you see 100 rupees of add the money. So how much is the lot of Nifty? 50. So you need a minimum of 5000 rupees. But you gave 5000 rupees, you understand, you gave 5000 rupees, this is a highly leveraged product. What does this mean? Rehansh, you tell people. From here you understand simply that leverage will be the first thing. Leverage does not mean that if you have 1 lakh rupees in your Demat account, then they give you 5 lakhs.\n09:30 No. What they do is. They give you a product with a margin in that product and you can buy more of it. Your money is the same. So what happened here? We bought the call. Suppose it is of 50 rupees. What happened in this is that in the future, you will get 1.5 lakhs, 1.8 lakhs, you will get 2 lakhs in cash. But here you have bought the call of add the money. You have almost, because 0.5 delta, etc. You will understand later. Now Greeks will understand. But almost you have bought equivalent to that, 5000 rupees. Right. Be bought. If you are buying a share, then its lot is 400, 500, so 500 shares will be bought. The profit on 500 shares will be yours. You could have taken 190 0:10:19,940 --> 0:10:06,588. So if 50 is written here, 50 is your lot, so 50 quantity will lakhs, but normally you will get the same profit in 5-10 thousand. But it is important to understand the concept of delta, do not miss the video, otherwise. If you miss the upcoming videos, it will remain in your mind. That I bought 50 shares, but there was not much profit, it will be less or more, so we will explain later.So delta you need to understand more. So you bought from 5000, now I will give you an example, for now I am telling you the example, at the money there is delta of 0.5, so just apply this much, If 1 rupee Nifty increases, then the premium of 50 rupees will increase. So this means that if Nifty goes from 18200 to 18400, Means if 200 points increase, then my premium will increase by 100 points. And how much did I buy? I bought for 100 rupees. So how much will my 100 rupee thing be? 200. So how much will my 5000 increase at 200 points of Nifty? It is 10,000. Double. If Nifty increases by 200 points, which you see in intraday, it happens many times that Nifty increases by 200 points, It does not increase by 200 points daily, but yes, a move of 200 points can come in a day. But the main thing here is that your 5000 capital has doubled. So this is the main concept here.So you are understanding this leverage, what did you get? Just by increasing 200 points, the money doubled. And this can happen in a day, but it is highly leveraged. You thought the market will go up, but the market will not go according to your thinking. Because if the analysis is wrong, that's why we were teaching you analysis first. Do the analysis first. Because now this is the thing that I have done everything, how will the money come? So the money will come by trading, but if you trade directly and do nothing, then you will lose. So if the market falls instead of 18200 here, then there can be a loss. And you will have a leverage loss. Because just imagine this is your capital. If you lose this here, then you can lose this in highly leveraged. So we should tell both sides that this profit is also very good if your analysis is good. If you are wrong in the analysis, then it is highly leveraged. You will also have a loss according to that as well as profit. So now what do you see that someone has earned 5 lakhs. If you put 5 lakhs, then someone has earned 5 lakhs. So it is simply a game of quantity. You were trading from 5000 to 10,000. Someone will have 5 lakhs, 10 lakhs, someone will have 1 crore, 2 crores. So if the market moves in your direction, then delta, that's why I told you a little. Because as soon as you buy up or down, the market is at 18200, but you have done 18400, then there is less delta. There, your premium will not increase by half a rupee from 1 rupee.\n13:09 There will be some difference. What will be the difference, we will tell you in the next video. Now put option is similar. Now many people love put options a lot. They think that money is made in put options. Why? Because when the market crashes, it falls very fast. What will happen if it falls fast? If the speed is fast, then the speed of premium will also increase fast. So the same thing is that you bought 18200 put option for 100 rupees and the market fell by 200 points from here. So if you had put 5000 into 50, then how much will it be? 5000, it will also be 10,000 if the market fell by 200 points from here. Because you bought this at the money. Now we are taking the calculation of delta to 0.5. So it is not a matter of 5000, someone may have more capital, someone may have less, but now let's come to the fun part. What is the fun part?Someone bought it, someone sold it. If you have bought the call option, then what happens in the market, option trading is a zero-sum game. If money goes to your pocket, it will come out of someone's pocket and if money is coming to someone's pocket, then you understand that someone is suffering a loss. So the day you are making a profit, someone has suffered a loss. So you have to understand that it is a zero-sum game. There are buyers and sellers in the market. You bought when you thought the market would increase, but someone thought the market would fall. So the seller thought the market would fall, so he sold the call option. The game of selling, I am telling you clearly, there are many people who are beginners, they may not understand at once, but if you want to make money, then you have to learn this. You cannot say that I am just a buyer or I am just a seller.You become an opportunist. Sometimes you will get an opportunity, you will feel that a volatile move can come from here. And in that volatile move, you can make a good profit in buying. So you will buy and you feel that the market is sideways, there is a range bound market. In the range bound market, you will make money by applying the strategy of selling. You have to make money. You don't care if you make money by buying or selling. Because the color of money is the same. You don't have to see that money is different. Money is made by buying and selling. You have to understand which strategy will fit now. Correct. Like I have done a lot of option selling, but whenever I feel that I am getting a little opportunity of option buying in the market, then I will buy options. You can say that yes, I have earned 80% money by selling, but I have also earned 20% by buying. So you have to think that when you feel the move, you jump straight into buying. When you are sideways, you can play a little strategy in option selling, but do not miss the opportunity of buying. The process is the same. Like I gave an example that you can have 5 lakhs and 10 lakhs. In option selling, that process is slow, but you will get money there too. So do both.\n16:05 I started playing cricket recently. When we used to play street cricket, we used to hit every ball straight. We didn't have to hit here and there. Hitting is also straight and if you go to every ball, then it goes to the fourth or sixth. But what used to happen was that one or two shots would be hit and they would get out very quickly. So what did the coach tell me now? First play by sticking. I have learned a very important concept in cricket, which I found very important in life that the more you walk in cricket and play. While bending, the longer you will play. What do these people do? If they earn money from the market, then they get ego. Their backbone becomes straight. You see, any cricketer whose backbone is straight, he can hit good shots. It is necessary to walk while bending. It is also necessary to walk while bending in the market and what I understood in the second concept here is that timing is very important, which I found to be a great concept in cricket and the stock market. One is timing, because the timing shot makes good runs. The second thing is not to hit a six on every ball. If you are able to judge the ball, then it is not necessary to hit a shot. You can also do defense and drive. What does this mean? This means that the six ball will come. Some or the other bowler will put the wrong ball at some point. He will put it up and will also give a full toss.You buy on it. You will earn money by buying out of the money at that time. You can do anything. Out of the money, in the money, whatever you do, but hit four or six less. You are ticking. You have to hit a hundred. Hitting a century means that you don't have to hit six sixes on the first day. You can't do it with a tuk-tuk. You will keep doing this. You are eating the ball. It is a waste of time. You have to make a balance between four and six and tuk-tuk. When the balance is made, the hundred will be automatically. You must also hear that many times people say that running between the wickets is doing very well. They are playing good cricket. What does this mean? When we are making money slowly, we are making money. This does not mean that we have to earn lakhs of crores of rupees every day. It is not possible. If someone tells me that I earn this much every day, it is not possible. The market does not give opportunity every day. So just learn what to do when money will be made. I believe this.Now you can tell me what you believe in the comments. Similarly, I told you about put options. So when do people buy put options? When they think the market will fall. And who sells put options? When they think the market will go up. So you have to understand the concept of buyer and seller. Because in the coming videos, we will do both buying and selling together. Now you will say that for buy and sell, no. Those are strategies. You are making four four lakhs. What does four four lakhs. Mean? Look, I just didn't tell you the concept of add the money, in the money, out of the money. We have made a video on this in detail.\n18:46 The link is on the I button. But I will give you a simple example. So here we have opened the option chain. Now you can see the option chain on the NSE website. Why NSE website? Because the Nifty option chain that I have opened, Nifty is a product of NSE. Similarly, Sensex is a product of BSE. Bank Nifty is a product of NSE. Now BSE is also bringing its banking index. So you can do options in both. Now if you watch Sensex from May 15, you will get the options of Sensex live. You can trade in it. But the concept of trading will remain the same. In the money, at the money, out of the money, the concepts of the options will remain the same.So let's continue from here. So we understand it in simple language, in the right hand side, you have put. We have understood the concept of buying and selling. Here on the left, you have calls. You understand it simply. You buy up the call. We buy up the call when we feel that there is going to be a higher level in the market. So you understand that if we buy 18,200 or 18,300 in the market, if the market has not reached there yet, then all these options means out of the money are those options which will come the market will reach there. 370 0:20:04,936 --> 0:20:02,880 will come out of the money. All those options are called out of the money in call side where the market has already reached like you can see here that the market is between 1850 and 1800 means the market has reached here where the market has reached is called at the money and the area which the market has already crossed like all the call options below this. All these where the market has reached is called in the money you can do. The opposite of this in put in put also go with the thought of buying that when do I buy put when the market will fall so if the market is running at 1800 and I have bought put of 1700-900. What will be called in put? Out of the money because the market will have to come at 1700-900. Then it will reach at the money so simple you can understand that if you see from the concept of buying then it will be easier for you. There is no difference in call and put what will be called in the money? Where the market has already entered like the market is running below 1800-200.It is running below 300 and at the money both are same in at the money. People get confused because here there are double strikes because there is a division of 50 means. There is a division of 1850-18100 in nifty. So in this what happens suppose the market is at 1865. So sometimes you see both at the money in many places. In many places. It will be 1800. In many places. It will be 1850. It's vendor details because sometimes we buy data from a vendor. So it is for confusion and that is 100% ok because it is 18000 pass it so pass. It means it has gone above 50 but it is around 50 and then it is around 100 so you have to understand that if it is around that then you can consider both at the money. Here just to remind you. I have told you before this is yellow.I call it cream and I call it buttermilk so cream is expensive. Buttermilk is expensive correct. You tell cream is expensive cream is expensive. This is a simple thing so all the options of in the money all will be expensive and all of them will be cheap. So people who say to buy cheap. They go and buy buttermilk. But actually the value of buttermilk will always be less the value of buttermilk will always be more. So the butter you are seeing is of yellow color. That's why it is said nowadays that when you buy options add the money or do it in the money so that you get more return you are out of the money and if the market did not move well so many times the market. What do you know did not reach there. Before expiring you have a problem. Here you will not get profit that's why this cream area more goods will be made in this right. So I hope you have understood option chain here in option chain. Now I have not understood the whole option chain.\n22:22 I will tell you here because this is OI what is volume. What is IV. All this is still to be learned but I hope options as a basic. You must have understood in the coming videos. Now the strategies are left then their adjustments are left so a lot to learn is still left so if you have not subscribed yet if you have not clicked on the bell.

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 Hello Bull Truckers friends, April 2nd is about to come and Donald Trump is calling April 2nd as Liberation Day and the whole world seems to be very worried about this day and if you see, that worry is visible in the markets as well, so how did the markets react before April 2nd, if you see yesterday, you got to see the whole red zone and see how we got to see panic. And if you see here, the most Nike was down, it was down more than 4 and almost the whole of Europe was also down and if we see yesterday, the US markets were down. But if we look at the previous day, the Dow was also down by about 1.7 and the deck was also down almost as much, so all this redness that you are seeing is visible due to Donald Trump's Liberation Day, so you can see that every country is worried about what will happen next, but after that, the markets opened today and we got to see a little recovery. There, you can see that mostly we got to see green here, so is that fear over? If you look at this data carefully, you will understand the story. So, if you look at Hang Seng, it was down by 1.3% the previous day and then it recovered by almost half. If you look at Kospi, it was down by 3% and half of its fall was recovered. We saw the same thing in almost all markets. Nifty is different. Yesterday our markets were closed. Our markets were closed due to Eid and because of this we saw its fall today. So, what is it telling us? It is telling us that we are not scared. All markets were recovering.\n02:06 Asian markets were recovering in the morning but our markets were down. That means the market is also very worried about this tariff. So, all of you are following the news related to Donald Trump and you all must be up to date about what is happening. We will quickly see what development is happening on this front in the latest. So, the first thing is that Donald Trump has said that tariff will be applied on all countries. Such speculations were being made that perhaps it will be imposed only on some eight to ten countries which are imposing the highest tariffs, which also includes India. So they have made it clear that tariff will be imposed on everyone and recipe. Procal tariff will be imposed, there will be no relaxation.In this, they have clarified it once again and at the same time, if you see this point, it is very worrying. Because what it is telling us, it is telling us that the country which will buy oil from Russia and Venezuela will be charged.Extra tariff, now see, 36.5% of our oil imports are from Russia, so the threat of sanctions on us is also constant, on the other hand, our markets had the hope that negotiations are going on between our government and the government of Donald Trump, discussions are going on about bilateral trade agreements and it is possible that we may get some more relaxation in it, so here also we have not got anything special, on one hand, no decision has been taken in this yet and its first draft will take many months to come, so using that, India was wanting, our country was wanting that we should get some relaxation, but its hope also seems to be ending. Now, it has been said that that thing It is a matter of concern and whatever tariff is to be imposed, it will be imposed and some such news has also come that India is ready to a large extent to relax the tariff of 25% on auto parts that Donald Trump had imposed. So, India has now given this proposal that we will impose tariff only on 0 to 1, which we impose more than 15%, so we are reducing the tariff of 15%, so basically we are ready to impose zero tariff and you can imagine. When the American products will come to India and they will be available at the same price at which the Indian products are available, then everyone will buy American goods. As we have seen that the goods that come from China are cheap and the Indian producers, even the poor people of our country who make diyas and small toys, they have also gone out of business now because cheap goods are coming from China.\n05:20 In large quantities and the people who do business, there are emotions with them. For those who are not attached, father, brother and sister, the biggest thing is that they will go wherever they get money and we will see the same thing in the American goods that will flood our market and as the news is coming. Now that America is continuously putting pressure on us on agricultural products that we should buy wheat, maize and dry fruits from them and we have to see what happens next. But if all this happens then it will have a huge impact on our markets overall and will also have an impact on our economy and if we talk about China then it is also doing what is called arm. Twisting. There, we do not know what is happening with our country but at the moment it seems that we are negotiating but till now we have not agreed to anything officially, which is a good thing because if agreements had been made then the news would have come in the market and I hope that our government will not give much relaxation to Donald Trump and will protect our consumer businesses.\n07:05 So if we talk about the market, the market has completely come into panic and today when the market opened, people had a lot of hope that the market would go down as soon as it opened but initially we also saw a good recovery and the markets also came in green. But after that the real game of the market started and by the day we did not see any meaningful recovery in the markets and the way we are. Seeing the data, this panic is now seen spreading, what do we see in the data, let me share it with you one by one, so first of all let us look at the positions of FIIs, let us look at the positions of their index derivatives, today's data is not there. In this, this data comes late at night, so if we look in it, there is data till the last trading day. I.e. Friday and on Friday our markets were also down, they were not down much but what do we see there, so as I am continuously sharing with you that FIIs were cutting shorts of their index futures, the markets were going up, I had shared this data with you earlier also and when I told you this.It was said that the rally will come, then this was also a data point on the basis of which I had told you that FIAs are no longer making fresh shorts and now. Due to this there is a chance of a rally and the rally may come and now see what is happening, it seems that they have cut all the shorts they had to cut, so on Friday they have increased the shorts and a good number of shorts have increased here, so if you see here, they had about 30000 shorts, see, by reducing from 2 lakh contracts, they brought it. Down to 30000 contracts, they cut almost all the shorts and now the phase of increasing has started, it seems so they have increased the shorts from 30000 to 50000, that is, they have added 20000 shorts and the way the market has fallen. Today, it is expected that their shorts would have increased today also. Now let's talk about VIX, friends, so VIX as I had shared with you, if you are continuously watching my videos and I have shared with you by showing my indicators.\n09:24 It was predicted that VIX will increase in the coming days and it seems to be happening almost the same way. So even today if you see, VIX is seen increasing in the markets. So here if you see today, VIX is seen increasing here. Before that we also saw a rise here and you will see that as the markets fall, VIX will be seen increasing. And if we talk about IVs, we have also seen a rise in IVs. Now in the options of April, IV has also increased from 12 to 13. There has been an increase of about 2-3 per cent and it is expected that these IVs will increase further.\n10:08 Now let us see the data of Nifty futures, what we are seeing there. So here as you see, I am showing you two charts. The first chart is showing us the Nifty spot and the open interest addition of Nifty futures for the month of April. So here we can see that a lot of positions were added because new expiry was starting and the positions were rolled over. So this position It got added here but as I am continuously showing you how to find out whether it is a short position or a long position, for that we will see this chart and see what you see here, here we are showing this chart of Nifty spot and along with it that its future of April month is at discount or premium, so we know that the price of futures is often higher than spot, so its difference is called premium, so here you see so. Many positions got added and your premium went down in comparison to the previous days, so what does it tell us, it tells us that the smart investor in the positions that were being added was shorting Nifty, somewhere he knew that the markets will fall and he was shorting and due to this reason the premium suddenly started falling when these positions were added. Here, that is, rolled over happened, now let us correlate this in the options market as well and see whether the options market is also telling us the same story, so let us see in the put call ratio that here. But what are we getting to see, the same story which was seen in Nifty futures, so if you see in this tool, we are seeing two charts. In it, this green line is of Nifty spot and this blue line is of Nifty's put call ratio i.e. Put o aa divided by call o aa, what picture do we get to see here, here you see.Nifty is seen going up. But this put call ratio is not supporting it, it is going down and it is continuously going down, so what is it telling us that here also shorting is happening in the options market, due to this reason the put call ratio is going down, so we saw that shorts are being made in the futures. Market and shorts are also being made in the options market, so the one thing I was telling you repeatedly is that the big players always. When there is a counter trend in the market, that is, when they have to make sell positions, they do it in the rising market because they short in large quantity, so it seems that they have shorted their shorts futures a few days ago. We had made the market and options in the market.\n13:16 Now let's do an analysis of the chart and try to find out where the market is going. So this is the weekly chart and what do we see in the weekly chart? Let's see. So if you are watching our old videos, then what did we share with you? We had said that this candle that is forming last week is very crushing. If it forms a green candle with a full body, it will mean that the market has strength and the market is going up. But here you see that it fizzled out, it could not sustain and it made the whole body loose and here we are seeing selling. Now the levels here, if we see that till this level of 23800 is not crossed, how did we find out this level, then if you see that here a resistance level type has been formed, two tops are formed there, that means there is selling pressure there. You got to see almost the same pattern here as well and after that the market went down.So if you take a long bullish position, then you will see that the resistance level is formed here. If you are expecting 1000, 2000, 3000 or new highs, then this level will have to be broken. So, the weekly chart analysis is that now let's look at the daily charts as well to see what we are seeing there. So if you look at the daily chart, then an interesting observation here is that at this highest point, you can see how big a volume was generated there and I had shared this with you earlier as well that a volume climax pattern is being formed, that is, those who had created positions here. At the lower level, they went and exited there and whenever high volume is generated at a higher level and after that the markets start falling rapidly, then it often indicates that now selling has come back.\n15:31 Now here is our next level, below which if the market goes, then it is going to give us a long pain. Which is that level? That level is the level for which a gap is being created and this level is 22950. So as long as the price remains above this, we We can hope a little that maybe there will be a recovery but if this level is breached then assume that the prices will enter the channel again. Now friends, what should we do next in this market, so we will not talk about it. In today's video, we will wait for April 2 and see what Trump sir does and what he says. And after that we will take a call, for now, looking at all the data points, it seems that selling is coming back in the market, so friends, with this I am ending this video here, do tell me how you liked the video and do not forget to share your feedback and what do you think friends, will the markets crash once again. Due to Trump or after just a day or two of decline, we are going to take a jump again, do not forget to share your feedback, thank you very much watching and thank you for your time."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 In today's episode of Un Funda, to understand what can happen in the stock market tomorrow, you will first have to understand how much impact Trump's tariff policy can have on India. Look, before we go over the chart, let me tell you some important points which will help you. What does India export the most to the US? By the way, whatever trade takes place between India and the US, it is the highest from India's perspective as compared to any other country. This is an important factor. In the exports of India, you will find the most major names like jewellery-related products.\n00:32 Even you will find electronic-related products. Well, there are a lot of things, jewellery, electronics and pharma are its major portion allocation. If we talk about imports, then the most major significant portion of imports is that of energy. So, I have told you that this is an important sector. Whatever India imports, India imposes a duty of 12% on the US on the basis of weighted average and the US imposes it. 3% duty on India, we still have a differential of 9%. If this differential of 9% is reduced and Trump. Sahab also says that we will increase the duty on India. Because Trump sahab can do anything at any time, then obviously there will be a negative impact on the Indian market, there will be a negative impact on the Indian economy. Experts believe that even in the worst case scenario, the negative impact can be from one to 1.5% of our GDP.\n01:19 All the reports that are coming on this, all the experts are saying, they are factoring the impact that this can happen in the worst scenario, so I have told you the basics, what happens, we get a news in front of us, we do not even know the basics of that news and we discuss that news, what will be the impact on the stock market, so you should know the basics, now if you come to the stock market, first of all you will check out FI and DI, then FII is regularly selling, all two. If you look at the long figures of FI now, then it is not much in this series also. Like in the March series, FII was very light, so in comparison to that we have become a little heavy, but overall still FI has not become very heavy, even then regular. Negative figures are being seen from FI, that becomes a little bit of a caution point, if you check out the US market. Now, then a downfall of 125 points is seen there, meaning there is a little bit of a soft environment there, but the Indian market performed very well today and after performing well, it has given a personal favorite candle.\n02:14 By making it. Today, the name of that candle is inside candle. What is an inside candle, let me explain it to you. In short, you understand that there is a mother candle, it is formed inside, the next candle is formed inside it, now you have to mark the high and low of this next candle, in whichever direction the market goes, your trade is made in that direction, suppose you have made an inside candle. The high and low have been marked.\n02:35 Next, if there is a breakout, then the breakout trade happens and your stop loss is here. If there is a breakdown, then the breakdown trade happens and your stop loss becomes the high of the inside candle. It is so simple to trade inside candles. So on the basis of inside candles, now here the discussion will be done that what expectations are being formed here? Inside candles are being formed for us tomorrow. We have to keep this in the back of our mind. Even if you talk about Bank Nifty, then here the inside candle is being formed perfectly. So on the basis of inside candles, let us suppose. If there is a breakdown, then in cases of breakdown, this will be your stop loss and here you can work with a risk reward of 1:2. So you will see all this.\n03:09 If there is a major gap down or gap up tomorrow, then in that scenario, in the first 1 hour, I personally would better prefer to wait and watch here as compared to doing any random trade. If you have to trade by the way If you want a free demat account, then you will find the links to open a demat account. In the description, you can go there and open it. Even if you want to work not only in the Indian market but also in crypto, then you will find the link of Delta Exchange India. In the description, you can go there and check it out. Let's talk about vix. Before we come to the intraday analysis, there has not been much momentum in the vix yet. I want to see the vix above 15. When the vix goes above 15, then the scope of big volatility in the market will increase, which we are also expecting. So your focus should remain on the vix.\n03:51 Talking about intraday, you mainly have to work on the inside candle. The inside candle will be in focus tomorrow because working in ultra short term tomorrow can be dangerous. This line of the inside candle will be very important for you tomorrow. Even if you go to the 15-minute chart and check out on an intraday basis, then you will know about it. As soon as you go, you will work with a positive mindset. Today's low remains an important support. As soon as you go below this low, there will be a breakdown scenario. So if you study this scenario tomorrow, then that is a better case scenario. More than that, I thought for you, why not ask Chat GPT as well. I have just done a fun exercise.\n04:28 And in today's episode, what will be the impact of the trump card decision on the stock market. See brother, what does AI say? What happens? Many times we have tools, sometimes we get some additional data. Specifically, whenever you ask such questions, whatever news articles are available on social media, this AI is going to give you a summary of all the news articles. AI will also mark important support, mark range, resistance and more than that, what is the volatility going on and which news article has been used. It gives data on everything. You will also get to know about sectors here. You can go and read it. Yourself, he has also explained the strategy, brother, one of the potential strategies is to do bear put spread, if you want to check out the video of what is bear put spread, then here I have given you the link, we have already given a video which you can check out, happy learning and I will see you very soon."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 So let me quickly share my screen and I'll tell you what is up right now why are we falling. Uh. Nifty is down almost by 360 as I was showing almost 360 points down almost at days low right now and what is happening it is. I believe the impact of trump tariffs which are going to become applicable from tomorrow okay. Now if you see here markets actually tried to go up and the selling was pretty much intense and that is where we are almost trading at days low right now uh. I'm sure you have two three first questions that if it were to fall Could It Go below 23,000 or not so we'll try and answer a few questions Could It Go below 23,000 if yes where could the next support be of course. Everyone knows the level of 22,800 but before that also do we have any support. Typically what levels of retracements could we. See is also what we are going to understand and we have to know what this Trump tariff could mean for India because it's so. I'm sure everyone has been listening about these Trump tariffs since a long time. But the important point is that it is going to be applicable from tomorrow that is 2nd of April and that is the reason why I believe that in anticipation that oh if he becomes really tough on India if he imposes a lot of tariffs on India. Then what U maybe it's the fear that is dragging the market down today and that is the reason why we have to understand that to what level can we go down and what could be the next big support okay because tariff is something which can create some sort of fear in the market okay. So first things first everyone is aware about this downtrend la la la.Uh very important is that this level the previous level of 23,800 that was challenged and for those who have been watching my Thursday live streams every single Thursday. They already knew that this was a make or break level. We were not able to break Above. This level. In fact we actually started taking a U-turn from here and we started to collapse a bit now let us try and understand as per Fibonacci levels from the lowest point to this highest point where we are right now so if you see today. This is where we have taken support at 38% retracement okay so exactly that is where you can see. Markets went down till today 38% retracement and from there it has started to you know regain a little bit of strength not much low. But this is where we have seen the first support what if this is broken then there is a great chance that we go to the 50% retracement plus you can see that there's a gap here. So this Gap also gets filled in that case. So there is a possibility that if this Trump tariff cfers keep on increasing a bit we may go down to 22,900. But I don't see it going below this as of now uh because whatever are the key fears that is what is being absorbed by the market. Today is what I absolutely feel uh so first and foremost let's try to understand what are the key points. So I hope everyone is clear in their minds right now where are we right. Now.We are at a 38% retracement which is at 23, roughly 145. I'm repeating if you want to write down these numbers 23,45 where we are at a 38% retracement and if we go down to 50% retracement it could be 22,900. Okay. I hope these two important points are Absolut what is wrong with today's stream. Uh why am I not going full screen huh okay yes now better okay first things first. I hope everything is clear about where could we go down to and 22,900 is where we could possibly go so.\n03:52 Everyone has to understand what is such a big deal with this tariff so another 3 to four minutes of your attention and you should be able to understand what is going to happen tomorrow. Okay Trump call calls 2nd April as The Liberation day and why is he calling that because he's saying that starting tomorrow that is second of April I'm going to impose reciprocal tariffs. Simple meaning is like tit fortat if we are charging 25% on any specific product to uh us for imports. Then us says if we are buying from India we are going to apply the same rate of tax so let's say if you are uh charging uh 50% on agricultural products which we are importing from USA USA is saying now if we import agricultural products from India. We will also charge 50% tariff that is the simplest meaning of reciprocal tariff question is is he targeting only India obviously not be it China Japan Mexico uh whatever India European Union everyone he he says that we are going to charge this to everyone and he's going to start from tomorrow. In fact he was asked why not 1 April you can see this on the news. He said that I don't want anyone to say that this could be like an April fools thing that I'm talking about that is the reason why I've taken it to Second of April.First and foremost we need to understand that how much is the impact on us. How much are we really exporting to USA and if I were to understand India versus US is India in a trade surplus or is India in a trade deficit. What do we mean by trade surplus. It means that India is exporting more as compared to Imports and believe it or not as far as trade between India and us is concerned. We are in Surplus and uh we are in a trade surplus of almost $45 billion. Of course. I I checked this figure on multiple uh news articles and it ranges from $ 35 millionar. Some say $0 billion. Some say $45 billion so even even when I read it for the first time. I like what are we in Surplus really but yes I I can see that oh shamik is saying oh really in Surplus. But yes that is what uh all the news articles mention uh. So so. Roughly 445 billion dollar of Trade Surplus is what we have in fact as per the latest data.India has exported goods worth 66 billion doar to the US now. As per so again. There was one research report that I was uh reading that is India rating of India rating and research report. They mentioned that India could lose up to$ 7.3 billion dollars in exports next year if Trump goes full on into tariffs so I'm just repeating the key points. What does this mean see currently. We are exporting around 66 billion dollar worth of goods from India to us. So this could mean like a 10% impact 10% impact if us were to go on with full-blown tariffs on India.\n06:48 Now of course India also understands that this could be big if we don't react to this if or rather than reacting let's be proactive. Uh is what India thought of and that is what we did uh. We had a three-day discussion which was planned in the previous week uh. It began on wednessday so Wednesday Thursday Friday. It was a three-day meeting uh which was going to happen if I'm not mistaken in New Delhi and uh officials from USA and India they both met and if something for bilateral trade could be signed off is what they were checking uh. It was initially planned for only three days. It got extended by one day so in total four days meeting was going on between how could we resolve for this uh trade tariff or this trade war between India and USA so good that we are trying to negotiate some bilateral trade agreements.The only thing is that we don't know what the outcome was it is kind of a secret thing uh and that is the reason why what was the outcome is what we are going to understand tomorrow. That is second of April okay so uh we. That is the reason why markets are uh trying to factor in that if something goes wrong then what that fear is being sold into the market. Today. I hope you're understanding why markets are going down today. My interpretation is mainly main reason is US tariffs.But please understand have we already taken some efforts for that answer is yes let me just quickly repeat three days of bilateral Trade Agreement discussions between India and us uh original plan was of three days. We did that in the uh previous week and additional one day was was the time frame with which this meetings got extended. Now. In fact India has already ordered for tariff cuts on imports from us and these are for typically farm products such as what such as almonds walnuts cranberries so see. These are some kind of gestures if we also show some gestures that okay we are ready to cut tariffs uh. Initially they have they have proposed this they have started. They said that okay we are ready to cut tariffs on agricultural Imports like what like as I mentioned Cranberries or what nuts or elements and they said that if we are ready to cut tariffs that is what we also expect from USA. So it is a negotiation and uh we will try our. I mean I'm sure India will try its level best uh to ensure that this bilateral Trade Agreement goes off to a good thing right so first thing I hope first thing you have understood a physical meeting took place. Last week for three days got extended by a day that was the first point second point. They have also agreed that the second round of talks will now start through a virtual mode. So it's not like bar meeting. Not like that they are going to take it to the second round and that will happen through the virtual mode. Third thing which is something really interesting is that to the best of my knowledge whatever news I have read. It is only India who is trying to negotiate that okay. No worries.\n09:50 We want to ensure that there is good trade between both the countries both the country. None of the country should be SE severely impacted and we should be amicably solving for this so India again I'm saying I may be wrong but to the best of my knowledge. It's only India who is trying to engage with USA for this mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreements. Uh I have not read in the newspaper if China is doing that or the European Union is doing that Canada Mexico uh something like a three four days meeting. That's that's not what at least I have read in the news um so anyways. It's it's a good thing that we are at least trying our best to reduce the impact of this and of course.Everyone knows about about uh the Trump and Modi equation uh and that's what everyone believes that he may not be going that hard on India or maybe. We have seen this uh Trump. Doing this that first he imposes tariffs and then he talks about withdrawing it if certain things are agreed for right so that could be one possibility. Uh now what could happen see if things go down south if in spite of all these bilateral agreements and this that if he decides no I'm going to uh put all the tariffs on on India is it only going to impact India. I don't think so understand that even though our trade exports could get hit us is also going to face the heat for that whatever Imports us is going to do from India.Now they'll become expensive so you can imagine for us manufacturers. The raw material prices shoot up and because the raw material prices shoot up of course. They're going to pass on that price to the customer because of which what will happen overall. Inflation can in USA now if I'm talking about two three products see automobiles is still doable but if it's something about Pharma I hope everyone knows that India is called as the pharmacy of the world and uh a lot of demand about for generic drugs in USA is being supplied by India. So if if they impose tariffs on generic drugs which are being exported from India to USA. Then obviously generic drugs will become so expensive in the US and I don't think uh Trump would want to take that RIS risk that you know some some people who are not rich enough and they relied on generic drugs. They could not afford to buy generic drugs because of it. Something happened there he would not want to take that risk so. I'm sure that there would be some areas uh where he would want to be a little bit you know. Calm is what I feel uh so it's good uh just understand one point that uh. I'm just repeating this that it's not only India who's going to get impacted. Us will also get impacted.\n12:29 Inflation can rise pretty much in USA. If this happens so all in all what is important is that what we have to understand this whole tariff. War thing is something which is driving markets in the Southward Direction. Right now is it extremely risky. Is it extremely worrisome. I don't think so uh could we have a hit could. We have a kneejerk reaction possibly yes. I'm repeating could there be a kneejerk reaction possibly yes and that's what we are seeing in the market today. Markets down by almost 360 points again as I speak right. Now uh could there be another jerk tomorrow maybe yes. But that's what I told you right. 12,900 is one level that we have already seen today 12,800 anyways so see the multiple why did I say 12,000 sorry sorry sorry extremely. Sorry I meant 22,000 okay uh let me repeat one more time U one more time see 23,000. Anyways is a psychological support followed by 22,900. The Fibonacci retracement that we talked about 20 22,800 anyways is a strong support so I feel two three multiple supports is what we have uh. So I don't.\n13:40 I mean no reason that we should just collapse like anything but we should understand that tomorrow is a big day U and it is because of this uh reciprocal tariffs thing that we are seeing some sort of negative sentiment in the market today uh so I just thought of addressing this U because I'm sure many people might be confused what's wrong with the market today. So I thought of uh just uh you know talking about this point of reciprocal tariffs anyone uh who I mean I get this a lot right should I be investing one chunk into the market right now what am I doing I'm telling you right now am I investing right. Now answer is no. I did not invest today. I'm not going to invest tomorrow. I just would want to see that really what is going to happen how much tariffs are being imposed uh and based on that I would still want to build a kind of position s okay so till then I'm not going to quickly jump into the market I'm going to stand by the sidelines. Whenever there are uncertainties I always prefer to have money in my pocket rather than money in the market okay.So that is that is what I believe can be a good strategy and that is what I'm going to at least do uh. We'll check what happens uh tomorrow uh and then would plan my next steps right U of course f u would I think that's that's a whole set of different discussion. A fear of recession uh maybe I'll do a separate live stream tomorrow or Day After Tomorrow talking about recession because that's a whole new discussion to be uh discussed. Not not not a small one uh so let's see okay why don't you become SE Ambassador okay out of nowhere okay anyways. So so I hope uh this. This is absolutely clear so don't get don't get worried at all uh passing phas uh for first let's understand what happens and then you can take your positions accordingly okay so whole intent of this live stream initially is was to tell you that uh what is this impact of trump tariffs uh that was the main thing and before I move before I end this live stream.\n15:45 Uh anyone who is from Bangalore. Uh just a quick reminder for those who have missed my previous live stream because in the previous live stream I had disclosed about my live event herar investor this time in bangaluru uh. It's on 12th of April already filling fast uh 12th of April 4:30 p.m. rabai timaa bandari Auditorium uh if you see the front seats almost this oh wow Gone Gone even balcony pretty much gone um. What we going to what is going to be the highlight Point. According to me is that uh you know uh. I've seen this happen in Pune event. I've seen this happen in the Bangalore event when thousand. It's like we. We gamify the whole experience in this event. It's it's not only a oneway lecture that happens in the live event in Bangalore. So you can imagine. I'm sure everyone has seen K Kona karati right in k k there's an audience poll. So the a big chunk of the live event happens like an audience poll.I ask questions on the screen. Everyone gives their responses through mobiles and so it's a total gamified experience that we are going to have uh in the Bangalore event. We are going to discuss about my target for Nifty in 2027 with a proper back back study of what has happened in the past uh. We are also going to have some surprise gifts at the event. Uh we have that that's a whole separate thing that happens after the event individual selfies for which people line up uh so it's it's fun. Even I get an opportunity to interact with everyone at an individual level also when they come up for selfies uh so it's fun anyone who is in and around Bangalore uh. The link for Bangalore event is there in the pinned comment and in the description box uh would love to see you all there we will talk about the current market situations. Also so of course we are going to have a separate AMA that is ask me anything in the live event also uh so would be really uh interesting to see you all um. So I hope this. This point about the Bangalore event is also clear and of course the main purpose of today's stream why markets went down and everyone should be sure that 23,000 is a good support.\n17:54 22900 is a support. 22800 is a support uh I'm getting one one or two more request quests about the recession thing. We'll try my level best to uh have a separate live stream only focusing on recession. We'll try and do that okay. So that's it from my side. I don't want to do this as a very big live stream. Uh I'll see you in the next one till. Then take care TR and bye-bye."

    "transcript": "Transcript\n00:00 Now Kediam's founder Sushil Kedia has joined us, let's understand from him how he feels about the market texture at this time. Sushil ji, good morning, good morning, so what should we do in this market. Now because a lot is going to depend on what Trump sahab will announce tomorrow, but technically how do you feel about the market players and leave aside technicalities, otherwise also what are the feelings that you get after seeing the mood and atmosphere of the market, see when Trump sahab was there for four years last time. Also, he makes things a little more weighty, his personality is such but ultimately what will happen is what the world is doing, the world will not run if run. By one person, he affects the emotions a little in the short term, the man is very realistic and reasonable, there was no war in his last term for four years, this time it seems that there will still be a war, I think the Israel matter is pending and he himself is doing the saber-tapping, Iran's own, it was discussed on the last Tuesday that a big bottom is forming in crude and Iran Israel's theater. He has started making those noises that he will return tomorrow. So on one hand the Russian war should stop, reduce and become completely tepid and on the other hand there is a pending theatre of Israel, Israel.Neither forgives nor forgets, that theatre is yet to come. The chart of crude is telling that if I move forward from there, the US interest rates have given a short term breakdown downwards, there should be a strong rally in US bonds, which we feared last Tuesday in NSD and SAP that they will hit a new low, they have already hit it, that low has already come down yesterday and that is why we have to fade today's gap down of Nifty, we have to buy the gap down.\n01:30 I had tagged you and posted a tweet on Twitter. Last night that by the time I met you in the morning, that gap down had become a buy, so now if we move on the larger time horizon, if any bank Nifty becomes 53000 in the next four days and after that it comes back to 47000. In the next two to three weeks, then I will not be surprised. I am not claiming that it will happen but we will definitely place this bet with a stop loss when that trade comes. For once, it does not seem that Bank Nifty will rise to 53,000 and who knows, the correction may retrace the previous low. But at the same time, there is no possibility of the old low returning inside Nifty. If Bank Nifty takes such a big hit, then it is possible that Nifty may not go below 22600 700 and the extra pressure that will be created inside Bank Nifty will be created due to ICICI Bank, Kotak, HDFC, Axis Bank. We may also short sell them one by one when we get signals but we will not short sell any PSU bank. We will take all of them in a pullback at much higher bottoms. So different stocks, different sectors, different indices will work differently. Anuj, it seems that the environment for a one-sided movement has not yet been created in the market. The market is still not in the mood for a one-sided movement. Sushil ji, one of your calls has been a little bold, although it has not worked till now, but today we will look into it a little.There has been a move in Vodafone Idea, which has been your big target, around ₹21 or ₹22, it is still intact. If PCR shows this chart, then see, we will talk with analysis, otherwise everyone has their own opinion. I am hoping to see this chart ahead. Now, if the previous swing high in Vodafone Idea goes above ₹7.83, then I will say to celebrate a new Diwali and that can come at any time. It may come above 7:48 or 783. We had last time estimated the possibility in Sharma-sharm fear that public criticism happens very easily in the social media environment. These days, there is pressure on the mind, so I had said 202, but look, today. I am plotting this chart fearlessly. I am not predicting 36. I am saying to keep the space open till 36.\n03:46 Look, the company in which everything is over, now Raja is betting with it. Do not bet against Raja. And those who are criticizing this on social media, But why is the government investing the taxpayer's money. In a completely beaten down company at a premium? Bhaiya, the government is not investing any cash. The government is converting the taxpayer's money into equity, there is no chance of AGR dues coming out, the way the company's condition has become, if the debt is converted into equity, it is the shreddest play Hatch Fund, the shreddest corporate finance play in the world, is to convert distress day into equity and this creates a spiraling effect, it is a very heavy gamma trade, this is a long gamma trade, those who understand the theory of options, in corporate finance terms, options are exclusively long gamma trade, this on a bankruptcy situation, so it is not impossible to have such a gain of five times or six times, it has often been seen in distress day equity and if the policy is in the hands of the government, the largest shareholder government, the government determines that we do not have to create a two-player situation, but a three-player situation and along with that the day to day management is not in the hands of the government, then gold. But there is a icing on the cake, and the charts are also reflecting this here.If we pass our opinion on the basis of our limited judgement, then we will not be able to become investors. If there was so much of a problem, its price should have been zero, it should have been three. There is some reason, then it is 7, so as soon as it moves above 780, we will resume that call again.\n05:05 We will review at 2122. Before that, we will absorb whatever volatility there is. And I cannot rule out that it will not become 35 or 36 in a year. I am not forecasting it. That is a possibility. Whoever likes it may take it, whoever does not like it may not take it.Sushi ji, you know what is the problem in that. Let me tell you, now I will give you my view in this. Now, there is equity of 10,800 crore shares in it. And now, even if Vodafone is not able to pay and if even in the future the government has to convert it into equity, then its equity base will increase to around 18,000 crore on the face value itself. Around 00 The market cap of the company will be ₹ 30 crores and if you say ₹ 5400 crores market cap, then you will get a much better profitable Indian company in such a market cap. See, this is an unusual situation on which our intellect is usually that once upon a time, when the price of Steel Authority of India Limited was ₹ 6, its equity was 4400 crores and the floating stock was only 400 crores, so your regular EPS and PE calculations will be on the overall balance sheet and the play of the stock was only on 10% floating stock, so if all this floating stock remains the same and even if the equity increases, then we will see. In the coming time, see, there are concerns, there is surprise, there is amazement, that is why there is risk and there is risk. Only then there is love in the market, if it goes above 783, then I will take it at Vodafone price by placing a stop loss of eight. Annas and the rest of the concerns will keep on thinking over a period of time, how will the camel change its direction. We will see, but if the question is reversed, if there are so many problems, does anyone have the courage to short sell? So, we will go long. You are absolutely right. A lot will depend on the floating stock. The floating stock will remain the same. Which government is going to come and sell it? Well, let's talk about some more things. Now, at this time, you had a long list of stocks. This time, there are many stocks that are ready for breakout or breakdown. Ah, let's talk about them. Which stocks do you like? See Anuj, the market came out from the previous bottom and after that, the picture has changed a little. So, it is more important to highlight that picture and I will share the list accordingly.\n07:13 In any sector, all will increase one-sidedly and will not decrease. For example, suppose in banks, we have said that we will get pullback to PSU banks and we are ready to short sell private banks. As and when the signals come, if I come to NBFC, whether it is Chola, Shriram, Munnapuram, Bajaj Finance or Bajaj Fins: There may be chaos in Bajaj Fins and if it pushes Nifty down too much, then all NBFCs are for sale for us, but we will not sell even a single insurance stock. Now if I come to steel, JSW Steel may give a correction of 20%, it may be a candidate for short sale and we may get a picture of buying Steel Authority of India Limited again in a pullback of 5-7%. So, in the same sector, stocks of the same type are moving differently. Deep profit taking may come in Hindalco and NALCO may increase by 20% from here. In trading, completely different charts of different stocks are formed in the same sector. This means that the market has not caught the one-sided theme. So, if I go out to find some stocks that have generated a very big picture in a little long term time horizon, then there are many such stocks that if you ignore the daily uncertainties of 15 days or one month, then I feel a stock like Bosch can be bought from here. A stock like X will double from here onwards.Take any pullback in Tata Motors, put any amount of China, put JLR, all of them are tired of using their usual intelligence. Its chart is such that whenever there is a downside gap, whenever there is a downward shock, the stock is gathered. Whatever negative opinion was to be formed on your Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto, has been formed. These charts are now moving towards a higher spiral. So whether it is two wheelers, four wheelers, autos or a stock. Like your CDSL, I think it will double, but Bombay Stock Exchange may not give opportunities for more than 25-30% trading swings.\n08:59 So even now Anuj, the market has not become as much as one can take a one-sided sweeping view. If Hood feels that the final bottom has been reached, LIC Housing Finance, the final bottom has been reached, then Housing Finance, Credit Card, SBI Cards, Insurance companies have to be taken for investment, the rest of the NBFCs have to be sold and if I take another example, if FMCG stocks are ready for long term delivery buy, once We will not give a huge gain immediately because Nifty did not go above 24,100 and then it will fall by 1000 points. So some of those stocks may test their lows again. Or in defensive play, you will take FMCG and in aggressive play, you will trade one stock and sell one stock in different sectors. So that is the type of market and wherever there is a long term place, I have told you four-five names and then I will tell you in the next week. For example, if you want to do short term trading of IT stocks, then even if there is a fear of 1000 point correction in Nifty, I will not short 100 shares of any IT stock. I will not short Dr. Reddy's and Sun Pharma. We have to take them only in pullbacks. So there are some stocks which are working by taking them in pullbacks and there are some stocks which have to be shorted and the index will play its own game.\n10:01 In that way, a little mixed kind of market has been created. Let's talk a little bit about what is the view on dollar, what is the view on interest rate and what is the view on gold. A one way rally is going on, what is your view on it? First of all, let me explain the chart of gold on which our mark has been raised a little and I will explain gold with the help of this silver chart. CR, please show me this chart, it is a very important chart. If the silver chart comes on the screen, if I see a 22-25% recession in silver from here, then in that affair, there is no picture of a bullish play in gold. The chart of gold is a little complicated, I will show it after a second.See, the mischief of Israel and Iran on 23 May last year and the trading top that was formed there, after that, if another slightly higher trading top was formed here, then the sell off happened again, then a slightly higher trading top is being formed. In created wave terms, this entire setup that is being formed, there is no five wave anywhere. In it, it is an irregular B wave pattern, at any time its sell off will suddenly break the level of $27, so when it breaks, then we will take it in silver, in the same way, there will be a sell off in gold as well. It is a complicated setup, a person goes mad on every new high and takes it to every new high, this is tempting the market, leave it, from 1900 to $2700. We played a bull run in gold when no one else could play it and now from 2700 till.Now we are in the wrong, so in that wrong everyone's wrong is different, everyone's right is different, I will wait, I am not going to get tempted in gold, the day gold gives a sure reversal, we will short that day, till then if we have to miss the opportunity to earn 2000, 3000, 4000 in gold, then we will miss it because most of our investors are day traders or cannot change the view in two-ten hours, no one has this much mental flexibility, so leave two-four000 of gold, we have to earn a bearishness of ₹00 in it and we will wait, in gold, US interest rates have started moving down once and it is possible that India is not able to show the chart in 10 year rate while changing. The chart will take time. India 10 year rate may give a little surprising upward movement to the people in the next 101 days and there has been a substantial strengthening of the rupee and the dollar. If this chart gets loaded, I will show you this chart which has been loaded, if there is a correction of up to ₹2.50 on the rupee chart. For once, then I will not be surprised and in the long term, it is possible that the rupee will now move towards strengthening because the dollar index may become very weak in the perspective of the next one year or one and a half years.\n12:35 Ok, Sushil ji, thank you very much. Do you have a special call for 30 seconds? We have a particular stock which looks good. Special call. If you sit with Exide, Bosch, CDSL, taking a little long term perspective in this market, we have kept all these stocks in the double-triple category. The long term reversal of these two container corporations that had to make me sad has already come. Container Corporation seems to be worth ₹2000, but you will have to be patient. For two years, it will not be built in two days, this Container Corporation may become 2100, 2200 for Rs. 700. By the way, there are a lot of stocks like Doubler, Tribler, Don't spend. The money in Nifty Bank Nifty, Nifty Bank Nifty can still create a spectacle for a month or 20 days. Good stocks are available in fire sale, Durga Puja. Sale is going on in the market, pick up good things, make your portfolio good. We will conclude the show on this auspicious note, Sushil ji, thank you very much for joining. Us. Today, we will talk to you again next Tuesday."
