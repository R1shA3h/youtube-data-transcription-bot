      "text": "00:00 Hi this is PR Sundar Welcome to this special episode where I'm going to talk about uh the medium-term outlook for our markets. Uh maybe from now to December maybe 8 9 months right. Uh we will be looking at both some uh news flow. Uh they are not exactly fundamental analysis but you know strategic news and this and that and plus we also look at the technical analysis. Uh let me go to the computer straight away. Now. So this is the daily chart of nifty. Uh I'll just give you some uh small background uh what has happened in 2023 around the end of October. So there are some small correction hit some lowest point uh lower point around 19,000. What has actually happened during the next wonder of year. There was a very very fantastic rally maybe 2 years and Nifty moved from around 19,000 to uh 26,300 that was a 7,300 point rally. So that's almost 40% rally in a matter of one and a half years. The rally was triggered by two major events and one the Fed chairman's announcement that going forward the interest rates will go down in US and second one uh after winning major state elections uh in November 2023. The expectation that BJP will be winning the parliament election in 2024. So this expectation of BJP and uh US Fed chairman's announcement regarding the uh rate cut. So that start started and triggered a huge rally. That huge rally went nonstop from 19,000 to 26,300 around there. What has happened at that point of time. Uh maybe you know this markets rallied because of you know uh even due to many negative points.Also sometime in February last year you know finance. Minister has presented one of the worst budget in terms of stock market because she increased the ST. She increases. She increase the short-term capital gain tax. She increase the long-term capital gain tax so she increase the ST. Then you know indexation."

      "text": "02:49 Benefit was taken taken out for many asset classes you know so but despite that you know the rally you know that's what I always say if you are traveling in a car with 100 km speed. Even if you apply a brake okay. It won't stop there you know it will move another 10 20 m and 10 20. Ft. Then only it will stop so that's why this more powerful rally from 19,000. You know even when there some bad news came so you know it did not stop. There it moved further higher and then at some point of time. So FA felt no enough is enough and this is you know too big rally. The Indian valuations are so high. In this period you know only the nifty moved 40%. There are many many stocks like PSU stocks you know they all moved in a five time 10 time 20 time. You know uh like you look at some PFC look at uh BC. Look at Magon talk no RJBNL. So many there are so many public sector companies. BSC is not a public sector. You know so they all shot up like five time 10 time you know unreasonable valuation. Then they thought you know okay. Now it is time to book the profit No FA can invest in any market in the world. Why should they invest here then they started selling here.So this is a very very major correction Okay Nifty has fallen nearly 4,000 point. So therefore this is already a medium term. So we are looking at last 6 7 months picture. So to forecast next six 7 months picture. So therefore know this is uh a fair level. So we take from here. So first let us look let us look at this chart. So market peaked out around this place. Then correction came. So it corrected up to this point Okay. Now what I do I'll draw a Fibonacci retracement. So from this level to this level Okay So if you look at this Fibonacci retracement level. Okay I may not try accurately but a little bit here and there is okay. So the markets actually fallen from uh around 26300 to 2300. So that is about uh uh around 3,000 point."

      "text": "05:25 Now what happened then there was some recovery. So this recovery you know where this recovery ended you see okay. Uh this is a 50% Fibonacci retracement and see. This is where the recovery ended. As I gave you the story of a car. You know even apply break. It won't stop exactly so it won't exactly reverse from 50% and a little bit that only an intraday and on a closing basis there was only one day Nifty closed above this 50% Fibonacci retracement. Next day started falling right okay. So uh in a technical analysis. This 50% Fibonacci retracement is considered to be a very very important level.Right so 3,000 point fall 1,500 point rally and exactly at uh this uh this point you know it has uh reversed this level. Okay So exactly reversed and reversed. Once it has reversed it should not break this low. What has happened you know it came down crashing down and it broke this level. That is a sign of bearishness. And then you see from that level. The market has fallen even more Okay. So this is a uh nearly 4,000 point fall. Then what happened now the market reversed Okay. Once it reversed at least this should be a resistance. So this is around 23300. So you may remember in my YouTube channel. Many times I talk about 23300 was the resistance resistance you know. So that has taken out. So now that has taken out the market moved higher. Now it is correcting a little bit or we can say it is consolidating. Now if you look at the bigger fall from here to this low. Okay I'll just drag this number this picture to this level. So if you look at from this level to this level now if you look at the 50% Fibonos retracement. So that is coming around uh 24,136 or we can say 24100 to 24150. So this is the major resistance Okay Right."

      "text": "07:57 Now there is a peak here. It came down so much now reverse. So this is you know some people are thinking that you know so. This is a kind of a double top Okay. So because people think that this is kind of a double top some some kind of a profit booking is coming. So that is why I said you know if the market has to sustain the rally. The first this level has to be taken out Okay that is the recent high of 23869. So this is what I've been telling in my YouTube channel. So once this 23300 has taken out okay uh I said then that becomes the support now. So now the support is 23300. The resistance is uh short-term resistance is the recent high of 23,869. But once that is taken out okay then there's this double double top is will not work any longer than the fibon fibonus retracement. So in a longer time frame the market fell 50% retracement again fell very big now inching towards the 50% retracement. So my opinion is that you know uh 24150 is going to be a very very important resistance. So if that is taken out okay then the next resistance is 24 uh 650 and then next one is uh 25 400 and then final one is a 100% retracement but given that uh the Trump uncertaintity so if you analyze the US market is working something. Like this.Uh markets fell after the Trump. Uh tariff thing started but that was not a long-term that's a short term markets fell then for one week 10 days. Trump was keeping quiet recovered now again he started talking. Now it fell and broke that day's low okay so now. On April 2 people are waiting what Trump is going to talk and there are many other things are going on in a global markets okay so uh what is happening for the next few trading session. Maybe at least for one to two weeks. Uh things are not certain so there are so many uncertaintities are there so technically if you are watching."

      "text": "10:34 24150 is going to be a resistance and until then I will maintain my bearish view because for the last few months I've been maintaining my bearish view. Once nifty crosses 24150 closes about 24150 at least for a day or then I will turn bullish. My bearish view is gone. Although market has fallen you know although market has recovered uh nearly 1,800 points but still we are not bullish. You are only looking at the nifty. If you look at the midcap small cap you know broader market okay. I think somewhere I read still you know about. Uh 75% of the stocks are in death cross death. Cross means you know 50-day moving. Average is below 200 day moving average so the stock wise you know. Things are not looking good okay and there are lot of uncertaintities going on especially from uh US administ ation. So they all will take some time to subside. So maintain uh bearish view until Nifty crosses 24150 and then you can have a bullish view. So that is a short message. This is based on the uh you know Fibonacci retracement levels. Of course you can also look at death cross golden cross. You can look at other technical parameters right uh so this is just one because I'm a mathematician. So fibonosi uh fibonosy sequence comes from mathematics only. So therefore I tend to believe this fibonosy more and then always remember.Technicals are just only a guideline. So there is no guarantee that this will work always. It all depends upon what time frame you take you. Know. I took last October as a starting point. You know things can be different right. So nobody can be very very accurate. So we are talking only about the probabilities. We are not talking about the uh certaintities right. So now the Trump is talking about tariff against India that's likely to affect automo likely to affect paraceutical likely to affect uh you know uh IT stocks right. And funny thing is that you know in normal beer market. Normal downtrend market FMCG stocks will do well but this time FMCG stocks are the one falling more right. So things are all changing you know the people say that you know uh rural demand is going down uh number of middle- class people coming down in India. You know the people are struggling you know all kinds of so more. I talk then it becomes more political so let us not go into that okay so we restrict only our discussion to uh stock market right. So I can tell you even now uh don't be surprised by."

      "text": "13:40 You know few days of FIA buying because they've been selling consistently for last 6 months you know suddenly for 6 days. They buy you know things do not change from the longerterm perspective so in a long-term perspective or medium-term perspective uh. It is there so then you may ask one question sir what is the point of discussing all these things right okay uh all those who are thinking you know what is the point of discussing all these things okay go and check you know uh like somebody who sold uh. Let us say anything like 22,000 put option and 26,000 call option in December expiry. Uh about few months before see what is a quick pandle or maybe 6 months before right so you know uh. If you know the medium-term view you can also uh do some kind of a uh trade in the longer term. Okay. Maybe I will just show you one more thing Okay I log into my after account Okay. So this is just a paper portfolio Uh I did not do this trade to be very honest with you. I did the trade. After the I came back. I came out Look at this trade which was taken on 31st October Okay for the March series. That means what october November December January February March I've taken a 6 months view and that time I've taken a bearish view because I took a bearish view.I bought 26,000 put option. Then but I'm not an option buyer. If my view goes wrong I will lose money. So I financed it by selling a double. The quantity 24,000 put option. And then anyway I'm bearish. I sold a call option. Also Right March series ended already. So you want to analyze that trade Okay. This is a pay of chart. So that means your loss will be below 22,000 and above 26,000. So because when I did this Nifty was around 25,000."

      "text": "15:50 So I was bearish. So that's why I've done it. Okay. Now look at the total P&L uh. The margin was around 2 cr. Or maybe. Even you take it as 2.5 cr because now exper is over. They are not reflecting the margin even if you have taken uh 2.5 cr as the margin and you your profit was like how much uh like 1 cr. 23 lakhs so that's almost 50% return in how many months 6 months right so that's almost 8% return per month. Right okay of course here you seeing the picture uh end picture only right so in between what was the MTM loss and this and that you know I can show but then it will take very very long time okay maybe if you know how to use the uh option simulator in obstra you can go and do it yourself right but look at the funny thing I bought put option that has given 81 lakh rupees. Profit I sold 24,000 that has given uh 9 9 lakh 63,000. Both buy put also gave profit sell put also gave profit sell. Call also gave profit so all of them are profit but this is a combination of you know this is not a strangle. This is not a option buy so it's a combination of some strategies uh which normally we teach in our workshop right so maybe if you are interested to know these kind of strategies you may consider attending our workshop Right. So once again I tell you disclaimer I'm not a SEB registered REA or IA okay. This is just for education purpose and I also told you that this is a paper trade right."

What is the point of talking medium-term and you know what is going to happen in the short term. But I'll tell you the people who have a good view and you know who trade in medium-term to long-term. They make much better return than the short-term traders because you know short-term. It's very difficult to predict the market. So that's why people say you know. Uh seasons can be predicted but weather cannot be predicted right. So more or less you know 6 months one year down. The lane where the market will be going. One can judge more or less but very very difficult to judge uh the short-term things right. So I think I've taken enough time so I will look for another opportunity to discuss some other topic hope you enjoyed watching. This video thank you for watching."
